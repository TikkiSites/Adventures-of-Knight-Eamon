      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you love good stories with fun images? I draw illustrations that create stories and show emotion that help you connect with the characters as they progress. For an audience of adventure—or illustrator—seekers, my website will be just the place! It will have a progressing story about a warrior knight with matching illustrations. I will provide the story in a variety of ways; some chapters written in novel form with detailed illustrations, while other chapters will be completely illustrated like a storyboard or comic book. This website is a fun way to showcase the different types of illustrations I can do while also providing a fun story for the visitor to engage in. Start your next adventure with my website!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will rang from teenagers who want to read a fun story to authors looking for an illustrator. My website will have a progressing story for adventure seekers of various ages. One child page will have the chapters of my story with the illustrations where anyone can enjoy the story. Another child page will display just my artwork, so that various authors who are looking for an illustrator can see what I can do.  One last child page will be a contact page. It will have a form for authors to fill out to describe what kind of illustrations they want for their books.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: UnifrakturCook, New Rocker--backup font  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font looks like a midevil calligraphy that will work well for chapter headings.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>
      <h5>
        Subheading Font: Berkshire Swash
      </h5>
      <p>
        I may use this font occationally, either for a seperate/subheading or for the chapter headings for the chapters focused around the princess--instead of the knight.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lucida Sans Unicode  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is a sans serif font and can easily be read in large amounts of text.  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example

      <h3>Home page--Intro</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to (The Adventures of Knight Eamon), a website to combine illustrations with story. “A picture is worth a thousand words.” I wish to convey both pictures and words to create a fun, engaging website.
      <h3>To Authors</h3>
      <p>For any author that is looking for an illustrator, this website showcases many of my illustrations. See my work in the Gallery. If you like my style and feel it fits well with your stories, feel free to contact me. My contact information is provided on the Contact Me page. There will be a form you can fill out to tell me about your story and the types of illustrations you want for them. I look forward to hearing from you.</p> 
      <h3>To Any Adventure Seeker</h3>
      <p>This website is not just for authors looking for an illustrator. It is for anyone that enjoys a good story with good art. This website is to showcase my illustrative work, but it is not just a gallery of art. My illustrations have a story along with them. If you like stories where you gradually come to know the characters and connect with them through their progressing story, you may enjoy my story. Visit the Story to begin your adventure!</p>
      <p>The chapters and my illustrations will be displayed in a variety of ways. Some chapters will be written out in novel style, while others will be storyboarded like a comic book. Some illustrations will be detailed, while others will have a more cartoon feel to them. Please enjoy the variety of art and this web story.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting and enjoy your next adventure!</p>

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        The story of this website is about a young knight that is the guardian of a princess. Come read their story and connect with them as they set out on many adventures. Meet new characters and travel to distant lands. Enjoy this developing story, filled with mystery, adventure, and—eventually—a little romance. Enjoy the imagery of the story though illustrations and storyboards.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am building the story as I go along. There are a few hopes I have for my characters, but much of the story has not been developed yet. I will be learning more about the characters along with my readers. I thought this would be a fun way to build a story. As I complete each chapter, I will add them to this website. To receive notifications of Knight Eamon’s next adventures, you can follow me on Tumblr, where I will post when I add new chapters. (add Tumblr link)
