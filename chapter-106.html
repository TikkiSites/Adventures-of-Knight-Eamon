            <p>
              King Titus sat quietly as they waited in the throne room, deep in thought.             </p>
            <p>
	            “What do you think happened, Papa?” Princess Phoena asked gently.	            </p>
            <p>
              The king sat back as he answered, “It doesn’t matter what I think. What matters is the truth, which we will learn soon.” After a brief pause, he muttered quietly, “Perhaps.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a quizzical look to her father. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Before she could ask anything else, the doors to the throne room opened and the herald announced the visitors.  
            </p>
            <p>
              “Loxias of Solaris seeks audience with the king.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Let him enter,” King Titus said.
            </p>
            <p>
              An old man crouching over a cane walked into the room with a young woman beside him. He had a large nose and balding head. He was clean shaven, but several wrinkles on his face displayed his age. The girl looked to be about sixteen. She had wild red circlets of hair that flowed from underneath her bonnet and framed her delicate face. They both wore clothing that was tattered and muddied from their excursion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Your Majesty,” the old man struggled to bow any lower than he was already crouched. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Rise,” King Titus said quickly to keep the man from going any lower than he seemed comfortable doing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I thank you for taking my audience, Sire,” the man said. “I do not wish to place a burden on your shoulders.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am here to help the people,” the king said humbly. “Tell me, what is your problem?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We come from the village Solaris. We have traveled on foot for near a fortnight to seek refuge.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “So I have been informed. From whom do you seek refuge?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The old man hesitated. “I fear you will not believe me.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus gave an encouraging smile. “Please. I wish to help you. Tell me, who attacked your village?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man hesitated again. The girl placed a hand on the man’s shoulder for encouragement and support.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man gave a deep sigh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was a dragon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus’ expression changed to one of horrified disbelief. Eamon’s eyes widened as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “That’s not possible,” the king said, more to himself than to the old man.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man sighed and shook his head. “I knew it would be difficult for you to believe, but you must believe me. You can even ask as many of the people of Solaris as you need, and they will tell you the same.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Can you describe the dragon?” the king asked. His tone did not sound mocking or disbelieving, but more urgent. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It had a long serpentine body, a snout like a wild dog, a mane like a lion, and despite its lack of wings, it flew.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena sat quietly but listened intently to the conversation, wide eyed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus intwined his fingers and rested his face behind his hands, an intense look on his face. “The dragons of Lóng Hún have been dormant for over a hundred years,” he said quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The girl took a step forward and gave a small curtsy. “If I may, your Majesty?”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus gave a nod, “Speak your mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “My name is Vanessa,” she started. “We come from a small village, but even though we are small, we are not ignorant. Perhaps no one in the village has ever seen a dragon, but we have heard the tales and legends. We know a dragon when we see one.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No one is doubting your word, lass,” King Titus replied. “It is just a lot to take in. It is a drastic change to how things have been for so long. Some doubted the dragons would return. According to legends, the dragons of Lóng Hún were peaceful dragons, and the people of Lóng Hún honor and revere them as spiritual guides. Why would they suddenly come and attack innocent people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The old man spoke, “We do not know the reasons. Nor do we wish to alarm you, Sire. We only wish to inform you of what has happened.” He paused then gave a deep sigh and continued, “And to give you a warning. If the dragons continue to raid towns and villages, your people are in great danger, and who knows what they will do if they come here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Were there any fatalities or severe wounds?” the king asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man gave a sigh of relief. “Thankfully not. A few have minor injuries, but thankfully someone saw the dragon coming and was able to warn the village. The major destruction was on our properties. We will not be able to return home for some time. Many of us don’t know if it is safe to go back.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus nodded in understanding and deep thought. “I appreciate you coming and informing me. You will be escorted back to your people in the town square. My men will return to you when arrangements can be made for your village.”
            </p>
            <p>
              They gave small bows and were escorted out of the throne room.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus sat quietly for some time, his brow furrowed in deep thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some time of letting her father ponder in silence, Princess Phoena broke it with the question, “Papa, what does all this mean? I thought the dragons of Lóng Hún were peaceful. Why are they suddenly active again and going against their nature?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am not sure myself,” Titus responded, gaze still on the distant wall and in deep thought. “If the dragons are active, that must mean the Mother Dragon has awakened—something that has been anticipated for over a century. It should be something to be happy about, but if this man’s story is true, I’m not sure that it is something to rejoice in.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do you think the man lied?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Titus gave a deep sigh. “I’m not sure. I believe he believes he saw a dragon, but it is hard to determine truth with so little information. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “But I suppose we must not worry about that at the moment,” the king changed the subject. “For now we must focus on what to do with these people. Whatever did happen, they have experienced a great misfortune. We must find some way to help them.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked into the distance for a brief moment, then said, “I am sure they are fatigued. We had a large banquet planned for tonight. We can cancel that and let the people of Solaris come and eat instead.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The King looked at his daughter with a pleased smile. “You would give up your birthday celebration to help these people?” he asked in sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” Phoena responded. “Their need is greater than my party.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled lovingly at his daughter. “You are a loving and generous girl. You will make a great queen someday.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              A large crowd gathered in the great hall and started taking seats at the tables. The population of the village was not large, but it filled the large room and even overflowed outside. Everyone was covered with dirt from their long travel. Some people showed obvious signs of discomfort, not wanting to sit in the clean chairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The King and princess made their way around the room, greeting the people and helping them feel comfortable and welcomed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon followed the princess at a close distance. If anyone wanted to harm the princess, being in the large crowd would be the opportune time. However, he doubted anyone would want to. They all just simply wanted rest and sustenance. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena spoke gently to some children that were crying softly. “It will be alright. You are in a safe place now. You will receive some food shortly.” She hugged the children, not caring that the dirt caked on them rubbed off on her gown. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When she spoke with the adults, she grasped their hands and said, “I am sorry for your misfortune. We will do anything we can to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena and Eamon made their way through the room, they met King Titus as he spoke with the village leader, Loxias. The young woman with wild red hair was still with him, her hand on his arm in a supporting and comforting way.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Your highness,” they both said as Phoena approached. The girl gave a curtsy and the man nodded a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              “From what I hear, you gave up your birthday celebration to help us,” the old man said. “That was a generous sacrifice. Thank you.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena shrugged. “It was nothing. I’m just glad we already had a banquet planned so that we could feed your village.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We do greatly appreciate it, Princess,” the young woman replied. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am happy to do it,” Phoena said. “Your name is Vanessa, correct?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, your highness.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena waved her hand. “Call me Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The girl smiled. “Very well, Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus turned back to Loxias and said, “The servants have prepared several visitor quarters to house some families. Unfortunately, we will not be able to house your whole village in the castle, but several people in town are willing to house families for the time being.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man gave a gasp of relief. “Thank you, Your Majesty.” He gave a bow of gratitude. “I am so thankful toward the town’s people for their help as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus patted the man’s shoulder. “We are happy to help. If you’ll excuse me, I must meet some more of your people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I should as well,” Phoena said. “I am always happy to meet more people. I can’t have too many friends, right?” She turned to Venessa, “It was a pleasure to meet you, despite the circumstances. I hope you enjoy your time here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Phoena,” Venessa said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, the princess turned to greet more guests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was about to follow the princess when Venessa tapped his arm. He turned to face her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a smile and said, “I have seen you with the princess, but I have never been introduced. May I ask your name?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hesitated, unfamiliar with this kind of situation. “I am Sir Ardel, personal knight for Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a surprised but friendly chuckle. “A knight? You look so young.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In defense Eamon stood a little straighter and said, “I am sixteen.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an apologetic smile. “I’m sorry. I did not mean any offence. I was just surprised that a young man of sixteen would already be a knight. You have accomplished much already in your youth. That is very honorable of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon, not used to being in a social situation, did not know how to respond. “Th-Thank you,” he stuttered in uncertainty. “If you will excuse me, I must return to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You can see her from here,” Venessa stated. “She is not far. Please, I just have a couple questions, then you can return to her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked back to the princess. There was no visible threat as she greeted the people. He gave a nod. “Alright, but I must watch the princess,” he said, not turning back to Vanessa.
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an amused chuckle. “Dedication. That is an honorable trait.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon could feel his cheeks burn just the slightest bit. He said nothing. He did not want to admit that he was never comfortable in a social setting. Yes, he did want to fulfill his duty in keeping watch on the princess, but he also felt awkward talking directly with someone in an unofficial way. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Anyway,” Vanessa said, “I couldn’t help but realize the sacrifice Princess Phoena has made. This was her special day, why would she give it up for us?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon thought deeply about the question before answering. “The Titus family have always been generous. They love their people and are always trying to find ways to help them.” As he spoke this, he realized how meaningful their visits to the town were to the people. Why would he have ever complained about going to town with them? It was an honorable thing to attend to the needs of the people with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “They even help those that are not in their kingdom when they can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt the inspecting gaze Venessa gave him. “As with you?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              In surprise, Eamon looked to Vanessa. She gave a smile and explained, “Ardel is not an Orean name. They helped you in some way and brought you here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked to the king. “King Titus took me in when I had no family to do so.” Then he corrected himself, “In truth, one of his knights took me in and adopted me, but it was King Titus that found me and helped me find the home I have now. For that, I will always be grateful and indebted to him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is why you became a knight so early on? Well, it is an honorable thing you do, and honorable people you serve.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She took a step back and added, “I will let you return to your duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod as she walked away. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With the recent conversation fresh on his mind, Eamon looked at his duties in a brighter light. Even though Clarisa had told him many times before, he had not fully comprehended how honorable his responsibilities were. As he watched the king and princess attend to the people in need, he realized how special it was for him to work right beside them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He watched as Princess Phoena bounced a toddler on her knee and spoke playfully to him to cheer him up. Her dress was now dirty from greeting all the weary travelers, but she gave no mind to it. She thought nothing about herself. Why couldn’t he do the same? As he watched the cheerful disposition of the princess, the slightest smile curled his lips.
