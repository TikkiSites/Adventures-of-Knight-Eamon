            <p>
              King Titus sat quietly as they waited in the throne room, deep in thought.             </p>
            <p>
	            “What do you think happened, Papa?” Princess Phoena asked gently.	            </p>
            <p>
              The king sat back as he answered, “It doesn’t matter what I think. What matters is the truth, which we will learn soon.” After a brief pause, he muttered quietly, “Perhaps.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a quizzical look to her father. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Before she could ask anything else, the doors to the throne room opened and the herald announced the visitors.  
            </p>
            <p>
              “Loxias of Solaris seeks audience with the king.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Let him enter,” King Titus said.
            </p>
            <p>
              An old man crouching over a cane walked into the room with a young woman beside him. He had a large nose and balding head. He was clean shaven, but several wrinkles on his face displayed his age. The girl looked to be about sixteen. She had wild red circlets of hair that flowed from underneath her bonnet and framed her delicate face. They both wore clothing that was tattered and muddied from their excursion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Your Majesty,” the old man struggled to bow any lower than he was already crouched. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Rise,” King Titus said quickly to keep the man from going any lower than he seemed comfortable doing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I thank you for taking my audience, Sire,” the man said. “I do not wish to place a burden on your shoulders.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am here to help the people,” the king said humbly. “Tell me, what is your problem?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We come from the village Solaris. We have traveled on foot for near a fortnight to seek refuge.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “So I have been informed. From whom do you seek refuge?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The old man hesitated. “I fear you will not believe me.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus gave an encouraging smile. “Please. I wish to help you. Tell me, who attacked your village?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man hesitated again. The girl placed a hand on the man’s shoulder for encouragement and support.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man gave a deep sigh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was a dragon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus’ expression changed to one of horrified disbelief. Eamon’s eyes widened as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “That’s not possible,” the king said, more to himself than to the old man.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man sighed and shook his head. “I knew it would be difficult for you to believe, but you must believe me. You can even ask as many of the people of Solaris as you need, and they will tell you the same.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Can you describe the dragon?” the king asked. His tone did not sound mocking or disbelieving, but more urgent. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It had a long serpentine body, a snout like a wild dog, a mane like a lion, and despite its lack of wings, it flew.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena sat quietly but listened intently to the conversation, wide eyed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus intwined his fingers and rested his face behind his hands, and intense look on his face. “The dragons of Lóng Hún have been dormant for over a hundred years,” he said quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The girl took a step forward and gave a small curtsy. “If I may, your Majesty?”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus gave a nod, “Speak your mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “My name is Vanessa,” she started. “We come from a small village, but even though we are small, that does not mean we are ignorant. Perhaps no one in the village has ever seen a dragon, but we have heard the tales and legends. We know a dragon when we see one.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No one is doubting your word, lass,” King Titus replied. “It is just a lot to take in. It is a drastic change to how things have been for so long. Some doubted the dragons would return. According to legends, the dragons of Lóng Hún were peaceful dragons, and the people of Lóng Hún honor and revere them as spiritual guides. Why would they suddenly come and attack innocent people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The old man spoke, “We do not know the reasons. Nor do we wish to alarm you, Sire. We only wish to inform you of what has happened.” He paused then gave a deep sigh and continued, “And to give you a warning. If the dragons continue to raid towns and villages, your people are in great danger, and who knows what they will do if they come here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “How? By standing by, doing nothing but watch for threats that will never come?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa sighed and sat across from Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You want to serve the people of the kingdom? Most importantly, you want to serve King Titus?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, that is a knight’s duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Did not King Titus ask you to be the guardian of his daughter?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, but it is not a mighty job. It is far less than what I am capable of doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I feel you do not see just how important and honorable being Pricess Phoena’s guardian is. King Titus trusts you to protect what is most precious to him. He knows what you are capable of and knows you are worthy of this responsibility. By guarding his daughter, you are serving him. By protecting the heir to the throne, you are serving the people.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is an honorable calling. Do not be ashamed of it.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon walked through the castle doors carrying a basket filled with fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Ardal,” a guard at the door greeted. “General Renato is in the great hall with King Titus. He requested you meet him there so you can exchange with Sir Reginald.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Eamon said as he walked by and turned to the hall leading to the great hall.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he arrived, King Titus was talking with General Renato. Servants were going about the room setting up tables and chairs for the grand feast that evening. 
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato turned to Eamon as he walked up to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” he called to him. In a public setting, he would address his adopted son by his official title, but his eyes always spoke differently. Eamon could see in the general’s eyes a fatherly greeting, a sparkle that would cheer up anyone lucky enough to be called his son. Eamon felt a little guilt in not addressing him as “Papá” earlier. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon approached, he bowed to the king and greeted, “Your Majesty.” Then he turned to the general and saluted, “General Renato.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel Renato smiled, “At ease.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled and patted Eamon on the shoulder. “Good morrow, Sir Ardal. Are you ready for the festivities today?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” Eamon nodded. “I will be at your daughter’s side to protect her from anything.” Although he doubted she would need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus nodded gently. “Phoena will be joining us shortly.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Right as he said this, the door opened.
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess walked, or rather skipped, into the room with a couple handmaids and Sir Reginald following a respectful distance away. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Eamon,” the princess called out. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded. He did not flinch this time. He had become accustomed to being called Sir Eamon by the princess. For two years that is what she had called him, no matter how often someone would correct her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal sounds so formal, though,” she would say whenever someone would correct her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the princess approached, the King swept her up and spun her around. “Happy birthday, my little angel!” Picking her up was no struggle for him, yet as he set her down he added, “I suppose you are growing too big for me to be doing that anymore.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled and said, “Never for you, Papa.” She hugged him, and he gave her a kiss on the forehead.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, General Renato,” she said with a small curtsy to the knight.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, and happy birthday, Princess,” Gabriel Renato said with a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              She then turned to Eamon and said again, “Good morrow, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small bow. “Good morrow. Happy birthday, Your Highness.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She rolled her eyes slightly as she said, “I have told you a thousand times, you can call me Phoena. Especially on my birthday. I don’t want things feeling too stiff and formal.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a slight nod. She looked at him with an expectant gaze and waited. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Happy birthday, Phoena,” he tried again.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Thank you, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ah,” King Titus changed the subject, “the flowers for the center pieces.” He took a basket that held pure white lilies from one of the handmaids. “Thank you so much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena bobbed up and down excitedly, “Yes! We picked them just this morning.” She tuned to Eamon and added, “White lilies were Mama’s favorite.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That they were,” King Titus said with a gentle smile. He held one up to his nose and sniffed, fond memories lighting up his eyes. “They are as beautiful as you, my dear.” With that, he tucked one behind his daughter’s ear and she gave a small giggle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald stepped up to Eamon. “Sir Ardel.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Reginald,” Eamon said as they gripped each other’s hands. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was a quiet night,” Sir Reginald said. “No threat to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What else is new?” Eamon asked sarcastically.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sir Reginald,” General Renato acknowledged. “You may return to your normal duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald gave a salute to General Renato and a bow to the king and princess. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sir Reginald,” the princess said and gave a curtsy. Sir Reginald smiled and gave a nod, then he pivoted on his heals and left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena turned to Eamon and said, “I am glad your rest day was not on my birthday. It is going to be a great day, and I’m glad to share it with you.” She furrowed her brow, and tilted her head. “Then again, it is disappointing that you will spend the day as a knight, and not as a guest. You might not have as much fun that way.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am here to serve,” was Eamon’s response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena frowned in disappointment. “See? That is the disadvantage. You are here to serve, not to have fun.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” King Titus chided. “Do not pester Sir Ardel. Let him do his duty as he sees fit. I trust him to do well. Perhaps he will still have fun in the process.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt a slight pinch in his gut. He heard, yet again, how much trust the King put in him, but dreaded the upcoming events. He felt guilt in his thoughts of pessimism. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena turned to her father and said, “We were going to check on the preparations outside for the activities. Are you still wanting to come, Papa?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” the king responded. “You know how much I enjoy those activities myself,” he added with a wink. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We shall finish setting up the lily centerpieces in here,” one of the handmaids said to the princess. “We shall return to your quarters when we are done to prepare you for the party, Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Phoena said to them. “I look forward to it. It will be so much fun!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon groaned within himself. Though he would be in the hall while the maids prepared the princess, he did not look forward to the event himself. He did not consider listening to a bunch of girls giggling about gowns and hair as fun or entertaining in the least. At least until then, he could be outside and enjoy the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The group headed outside to the courtyard where the various activities would be played. Eamon followed behind as the king and princess talked with the servants setting up the activities. They laughed and joked as they talked about the future events of the day. Eamon did feel a pinch of envy for those that could participate. Perhaps the princess was right. Perhaps the party could have been more fun for him if he were a guest, and not a knight. Some of the activities sounded like fun games, far more entertaining than watching a princess be pampered throughout the day. But life was what it was. He was a knight, and he took pride in that.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they were finishing up, the group headed back up the castle steps. There they met General Renato once again, as he was reviewing the guest list with the entry guards.
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up from the parchment and smiled. “Everything ready?” he asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” Phoena said excitedly. “This is going to be an exciting day!”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato gave a chuckle. “I’m sure it will be, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Just then, a commotion sounded as the castle ground gates were opened and a knight ran through in a hurry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sire! General!” the knight called as he ran up the steps of the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is it?” General Renato called to the knight.
            </p>
            <p>
              “General Renato, King Titus,” the man was out of breath from running. “There are hundreds of people outside the town gates. …They are from a village a fortnight’s distance. …They seek refuge.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Refuge?” General Renato said. “From what?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man panted. “Their village was attacked.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Attacked?” King Titus said with great alarm. “By whom?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “They would not specify,” the knight said. “They claimed you would not believe it… if you heard it from someone else. …The village leader wants to tell you himself, … in person.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus put its fingers to his chin in thought. “Very well,” He said after a moment. “Bring the village leader to my throne room. I will confer with him there.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” the knight bowed and ran back out through the gates. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Papa,” Phoena said, a look of worry on her face. “May I be in the room as you talk? I want to know what is happening.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus thought for a moment. “Alright. Sir Ardel, I want you there as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Your Majesty,” Eamon bowed. He figured as much. Being the princess’s personal guardian, if the princess was going to be there, the king would want him there as well. He was not sure what to expect, but he was sure there would still be no threat to the princess. However, he found his mind wandering to what could have happened to this village. Memories from the dream he had just the night before flooded his thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The day looked like it was going to be much more eventful than he originally anticipated.
