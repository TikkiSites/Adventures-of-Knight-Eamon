            <p>
              Eamon walked slightly groggily to the kitchen. He sat down at the table that was covered in flour. Clarisa pulled a couple loaves of bread out of the stone oven. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Eamon, dear,” she said, the small wrinkles by her eyes deepened as she smiled. Her long hair was dark with only one small patch of silver. Her copper skin was rivaled only by the crust of the fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon did not respond with anything more than a slight nod, her smile faded. She knew something was wrong. She had raised this boy and knew his serious demeanor. Since his childhood he had been a somber boy. He had rarely expressed any emotion, but she knew the difference between his regular demeanor and when he was truly upset. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is wrong, dear?” she said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He blinked as if returning from deep thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              She looked at him with a questioning, but gentle expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ignoring her glance, Eamon asked, “Has General Renato left for the palace already?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa deepened her questioning gaze. “‘General Renato’? You are home, love. You can call him Papá.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s gaze drifted off to the distance again. He looked down at the table and brushed his finger through the flour. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s questioning gaze changed to one of compassionate concern. “What is it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hesitated. “I… I dreamt about my real papa last night.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s expression then changed to one of understanding. She gave a gentle smile. “Alright,” she said in compassion. “You may call him ‘General Renato’ until you feel comfortable calling him ‘Papá’ again.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to remember your real papa,” she continued. “But always remember,” she gently placed a hand on his cheek and looked him in the eye, “Gabriel and I both love you as our own. Although I did not give you birth, and even though Gabriel is your commanding general, you are our son.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon placed a hand on Clarisa’s and gave a small smile. “Gracias, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Ese es mi hijo.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              She ruffled his hair with her flour covered hand, making flour fly everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              “¡Ay no!” she exclaimed. “I have already made a mess, but now I have it all over you!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small chuckle. “It’s alright, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have two more loaves to bake. Get yourself cleaned up and they will be ready before you need to leave.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod. Once a week she would bake bread for Gabriel’s squadron of knights, and Eamon would bring the fresh bread with him when he returned to the castle for his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eat your breakfast first,” She said pointing to the plate on the far end of the table, where there was less flour. “You will need your energy for today. Princess Phoena’s birthday celebration will be a big event.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s expression returned to his regular solemnity as he thought about returning to the castle and his duties. The fourteenth birthday celebration for the princess would be a big event, but he was not looking forward to it. Granted, it would be the most exciting thing that would happen ever since he became the princess’s personal guard two years before, but every day seamed to be the same as all the other days. He would guard the princess from any threat against her, which was no threat at all. He felt more like a nursemaid than a knight, and sticking by her side all day while she was pampered for her party would not help bring any excitement to his day.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t understand,” he said more to himself. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is that?” Clarisa asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a sigh. “I don’t understand why I can’t spend the day with General Renato and practice knightly skills with his squadron. I don’t understand why I have to play nursemaid to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa gave another companionate smile. “Being Princess Phoena’s guardian is an important position, is it not?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I suppose so,” Eamon shrugged. “But I can do so much more that just stand around all day. I want to serve the king with all that I am. I want to protect the kingdom from threats and serve the people of this land.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What threats?” Clarisa chalanged with a thoughtful grin. “Orea has been in peace for several years. I’m afraid, though grateful, that being a regular knight is not much more exciting than being a personal guard to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, at least they get to go out to train and conduct pratroles. They get to help the people of the kingdom.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You train as well. When the King and princess go out to town, you serve the people then.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “How? By standing by, doing nothing but watch for threats that will never come?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa sighed and sat across from Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You want to serve the people of the kingdom? Most importantly, you want to serve King Titus?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, that is a knight’s duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Did not King Titus ask you to be the guardian of his daughter?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, but it is not a mighty job. It is far less than what I am capable of doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I feel you do not see just how importate and honorable being Pricess Phoena’s guardian is. King Titus trusts you to protect what is most precious to him. He knows what you are capable of and knows you are worthy of this responsibility. By guarding his daughter, you are serving him. By protecting the heir to the throne, you are serving the people.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is an honorable calling. Do not be ashamed of it.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon walked through the castle doors carrying a basket filled with fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Ardal,” a guard at the door greeted. “General Renato is in the great hall with King Titus. He requested you meet him there so you can exchange with Sir Reginald.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Eamon said as he walked by and turned to the hall leading to the great hall.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he arrived, King Titus was talking with General Renato. Servants were going about the room setting up tables and chairs for the grand feast that evening. 
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato turned to Eamon as he walked up to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” he called to him. In a public setting, he would address his adopted son by his official title, but his eyes always spoke differently. Eamon could see in the general’s eyes a fatherly greeting, a sparkle that would cheer up anyone lucky enough to be called his son. Eamon felt a little guilt in not addressing him as “Papá” earlier. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon approached, he bowed to the king and greeted, “Your Majesty.” Then he turned to the general and saluted, “General Renato.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel Renato smiled, “At ease.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled and patted Eamon on the shoulder. “Good morrow, Sir Ardal. Are you ready for the festivities today?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” Eamon nodded. “I will be at your daughter’s side to protect her from anything.” Although he doubted she would need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus nodded gently. “Phoena will be joining us shortly.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Right as he said this, the door opened.
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess walked, or rather skipped, into the room with a couple handmaids and Sir Reginald following a respectful distance away. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Eamon,” the princess called out. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded. He did not flinch this time. He had become accustomed to being called Sir Eamon by the princess. For two years that is what she had called him, no matter how often someone would correct her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal sounds so formal, though,” she would say whenever someone would correct her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the princess approached, the King swept her up a spun her around. “Happy birthday, my little angel!” Picking her up was no struggle for him, yet as he set her down he added. “I suppose you are growing too big for me to be doing that anymore.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled and said, “Never for you, Papa.” She hugged him and he gave her a kiss on the forehead.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, General Renato,” she said with a small curtsy to the knight.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, and happy birthday, Princess,” Gabriel Renato said with a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              She then turned to Eamon and said again, “Good morrow, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small bow. “Good morrow. Happy birthday, Your Highness.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She rolled her eyes slightly as she said, “I have told you a thousand times, you can call me Phoena. Especially on my birthday. I don’t want things feeling too stiff and formal.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a slight nod. She looked at him with an expectant gaze and waited. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Happy birthday, Phoena,” he tried again.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Thank you, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ah,” King Titus changed the subject, “the flowers for the center pieces.” He took a basket that held pure white lilies from one of the handmaids. “Thank you so much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena bobbed up and down excitedly, “Yes! We picked them just this morning.” She tuned to Eamon and added, “White lilies were Mama’s favorite.”
            </p>
