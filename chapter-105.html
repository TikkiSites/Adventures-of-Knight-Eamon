            <p>
              Eamon walked slightly groggily to the kitchen. He sat down at the table that was covered in flour. Clarisa pulled a couple loaves of bread out of the stone oven. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Eamon, dear,” she said, the small wrinkles by her eyes deepened as she smiled. Her long hair was dark with only one small patch of silver. Her copper skin was rivaled only by the crust of the fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon did not respond with anything more than a slight nod, her smile faded. She knew something was wrong. She had raised this boy and knew his serious demeanor. Since his childhood he had been a somber boy. He had rarely expressed any emotion, but she knew the difference between his regular demeanor and when he was truly upset. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is wrong, dear?” she said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He blinked as if returning from deep thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              She looked at him with a questioning, but gentle expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ignoring her glance, Eamon asked, “Has General Renato left for the palace already?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa deepened her questioning gaze. “‘General Renato’? You are home, love. You can call him Papá.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s gaze drifted off to the distance again. He looked down at the table and brushed his finger through the flour. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s questioning gaze changed to one of compassionate concern. “What is it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hesitated. “I… I dreamt about my real papa last night.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s expression then changed to one of understanding. She gave a gentle smile. “Alright,” she said with compassion. “You may call him ‘General Renato’ until you feel comfortable calling him ‘Papá’ again.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to remember your real papa,” she continued. “But always remember,” she gently placed a hand on his cheek and looked him in the eye, “Gabriel and I both love you as our own. Although I did not give you birth, and even though Gabriel is your commanding general, you are our son.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon placed a hand on Clarisa’s and gave a small smile. “Gracias, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Ese es mi hijo.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              She ruffled his hair with her flour covered hand, making flour fly everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              “¡Ay no!” she exclaimed. “I have already made a mess, but now I have it all over you!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small chuckle. “It’s alright, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have two more loaves to bake. Get yourself cleaned up and they will be ready before you need to leave.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod. Once a week she would bake bread for Gabriel’s squadron of knights, and Eamon would bring the fresh bread with him when he returned to the castle for his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eat your breakfast first,” she said pointing to the plate on the far end of the table, where there was less flour. “You will need your energy for today. Princess Phoena’s birthday celebration will be a big event.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s expression returned to his regular solemnity as he thought about returning to the castle and his duties. The fourteenth birthday celebration for the princess would be a big event, but he was not looking forward to it. Granted, it would be the most exciting thing that would happen ever since he became the princess’s personal guard two years before, but every day seemed to be the same as all the other days. He would guard the princess from any threat against her, which was no threat at all. He felt more like a nursemaid than a knight, and sticking by her side all day while she was pampered for her party would not help bring any excitement to his day.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t understand,” he said more to himself. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is that?” Clarisa asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a sigh. “I don’t understand why I can’t spend the day with General Renato and practice knightly skills with his squadron. I don’t understand why I have to play nursemaid to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa gave another companionate smile. “Being Princess Phoena’s guardian is an important position, is it not?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I suppose so,” Eamon shrugged. “But I can do so much more that just stand around all day. I want to serve the king with all that I am. I want to protect the kingdom from threats and serve the people of this land.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What threats?” Clarisa challenged with a thoughtful grin. “Orea has been in peace for several years. I’m afraid, though grateful, that being a regular knight is not much more exciting than being a personal guard to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, at least they get to go out to train and conduct pratrols. They get to help the people of the kingdom.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You train as well. When the King and princess go out to town, you serve the people then.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “How? By standing by, doing nothing but watch for threats that will never come?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa sighed and sat across from Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You want to serve the people of the kingdom? Most importantly, you want to serve King Titus?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, that is a knight’s duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Did not King Titus ask you to be the guardian of his daughter?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, but it is not a mighty job. It is far less than what I am capable of doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I feel you do not see just how important and honorable being Pricess Phoena’s guardian is. King Titus trusts you to protect what is most precious to him. He knows what you are capable of and knows you are worthy of this responsibility. By guarding his daughter, you are serving him. By protecting the heir to the throne, you are serving the people.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is an honorable calling. Do not be ashamed of it.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon walked through the castle doors carrying a basket filled with fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Ardal,” a guard at the door greeted. “General Renato is in the great hall with King Titus. He requested you meet him there so you can exchange with Sir Reginald.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Eamon said as he walked by and turned to the hall leading to the great hall.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he arrived, King Titus was talking with General Renato. Servants were going about the room setting up tables and chairs for the grand feast that evening. 
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato turned to Eamon as he walked up to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” he called to him. In a public setting, he would address his adopted son by his official title, but his eyes always spoke differently. Eamon could see in the general’s eyes a fatherly greeting, a sparkle that would cheer up anyone lucky enough to be called his son. Eamon felt a little guilt in not addressing him as “Papá” earlier. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon approached, he bowed to the king and greeted, “Your Majesty.” Then he turned to the general and saluted, “General Renato.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel Renato smiled, “At ease.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled and patted Eamon on the shoulder. “Good morrow, Sir Ardal. Are you ready for the festivities today?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” Eamon nodded. “I will be at your daughter’s side to protect her from anything.” Although he doubted she would need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus nodded gently. “Phoena will be joining us shortly.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Right as he said this, the door opened.
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess walked, or rather skipped, into the room with a couple handmaids and Sir Reginald following a respectful distance away. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Eamon,” the princess called out. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded. He did not flinch this time. He had become accustomed to being called Sir Eamon by the princess. For two years that is what she had called him, no matter how often someone would correct her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal sounds so formal, though,” she would say whenever someone would correct her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the princess approached, the King swept her up and spun her around. “Happy birthday, my little angel!” Picking her up was no struggle for him, yet as he set her down he added, “I suppose you are growing too big for me to be doing that anymore.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled and said, “Never for you, Papa.” She hugged him, and he gave her a kiss on the forehead.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, General Renato,” she said with a small curtsy to the knight.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, and happy birthday, Princess,” Gabriel Renato said with a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              She then turned to Eamon and said again, “Good morrow, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small bow. “Good morrow. Happy birthday, Your Highness.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She rolled her eyes slightly as she said, “I have told you a thousand times, you can call me Phoena. Especially on my birthday. I don’t want things feeling too stiff and formal.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a slight nod. She looked at him with an expectant gaze and waited. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Happy birthday, Phoena,” he tried again.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Thank you, Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ah,” King Titus changed the subject, “the flowers for the center pieces.” He took a basket that held pure white lilies from one of the handmaids. “Thank you so much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena bobbed up and down excitedly, “Yes! We picked them just this morning.” She tuned to Eamon and added, “White lilies were Mama’s favorite.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That they were,” King Titus said with a gentle smile. He held one up to his nose and sniffed, fond memories lighting up his eyes. “They are as beautiful as you, my dear.” With that, he tucked one behind his daughter’s ear and she gave a small giggle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald stepped up to Eamon. “Sir Ardel.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Reginald,” Eamon said as they gripped each other’s hands. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was a quiet night,” Sir Reginald said. “No threat to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What else is new?” Eamon asked sarcastically.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sir Reginald,” General Renato acknowledged. “You may return to your normal duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald gave a salute to General Renato and a bow to the king and princess. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sir Reginald,” the princess said and gave a curtsy. Sir Reginald smiled and gave a nod, then he pivoted on his heals and left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena turned to Eamon and said, “I am glad your rest day was not on my birthday. It is going to be a great day, and I’m glad to share it with you.” She furrowed her brow, and tilted her head. “Then again, it is disappointing that you will spend the day as a knight, and not as a guest. You might not have as much fun that way.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am here to serve,” was Eamon’s response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena frowned in disappointment. “See? That is the disadvantage. You are here to serve, not to have fun.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” King Titus chided. “Do not pester Sir Ardel. Let him do his duty as he sees fit. I trust him to do well. Perhaps he will still have fun in the process.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt a slight pinch in his gut. He heard, yet again, how much trust the King put in him, but dreaded the upcoming events. He felt guilt in his thoughts of pessimism. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena turned to her father and said, “We were going to check on the preparations outside for the activities. Are you still wanting to come, Papa?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” the king responded. “You know how much I enjoy those activities myself,” he added with a wink. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We shall finish setting up the lily centerpieces in here,” one of the handmaids said to the princess. “We shall return to your quarters when we are done to prepare you for the party, Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Phoena said to them. “I look forward to it. It will be so much fun!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon groaned within himself. Though he would be in the hall while the maids prepared the princess, he did not look forward to the event himself. He did not consider listening to a bunch of girls giggling about gowns and hair as fun or entertaining in the least. At least until then, he could be outside and enjoy the sun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The group headed outside to the courtyard where the various activities would be played. Eamon followed behind as the king and princess talked with the servants setting up the activities. They laughed and joked as they talked about the future events of the day. Eamon did feel a pinch of envy for those that could participate. Perhaps the princess was right. Perhaps the party could have been more fun for him if he were a guest, and not a knight. Some of the activities sounded like fun games, far more entertaining than watching a princess be pampered throughout the day. But life was what it was. He was a knight, and he took pride in that.

            <p>
              As they were finishing up, the group headed back up the castle steps. There they met General Renato once again, as he was reviewing the guest list with the entry guards.
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up from the parchment and smiled. “Everything ready?” he asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” Phoena said excitedly. “This is going to be an exciting day!”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato gave a chuckle. “I’m sure it will be, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Just then, a commotion sounded as the castle ground gates were opened and a knight ran through in a hurry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sire! General!” the knight called as he ran up the steps of the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is it?” General Renato called to the knight.
            </p>
            <p>
              “General Renato, King Titus,” the man was out of breath from running. “There are hundreds of people outside the town gates. …They are from a village a fortnight’s distance. …They seek refuge.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Refuge?” General Renato said. “From what?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man panted. “Their village was attacked.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Attacked?” King Titus said with great alarm. “By whom?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “They would not specify,” the knight said. “They claimed you would not believe it… if you heard it from someone else. …The village leader wants to tell you himself, … in person.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus put its fingers to his chin in thought. “Very well,” He said after a moment. “Bring the village leader to my throne room. I will confer with him there.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” the knight bowed and ran back out through the gates. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Papa,” Phoena said, a look of worry on her face. “May I be in the room as you talk? I want to know what is happening.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus thought for a moment. “Alright. Sir Ardel, I want you there as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Your Majesty,” Eamon bowed. He figured as much. Being the princess’s personal guardian, if the princess was going to be there, the king would want him there as well. He was not sure what to expect, but he was sure there would still be no threat to the princess. However, he found his mind wandering to what could have happened to this village. Memories from the dream he had just the night before flooded his thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The day looked like it was going to be much more eventful than he originally anticipated.
