            <p>
              Eamon walked slightly groggily to the kitchen. He sat down at the table that was covered in flour. Clarisa pulled a couple loaves of bread out of the stone oven. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Eamon, dear,” she said, the small wrinkles by her eyes deepened as she smiled. Her long hair was dark with only one small patch of silver. Her copper skin was rivaled only by the crust of the fresh bread. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Eamon did not respond with anything more than a slight nod, her smile faded. She knew something was wrong. She had raised this boy and knew his serious demeanor. Since his childhood he had been a somber boy. He had rarely expressed any emotion, but she knew the difference between his regular demeanor and when he was truly upset. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is wrong, dear?” she said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He blinked as if returning from deep thoughts. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              She looked at him with a questioning, but gentle expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ignoring her glance, Eamon asked, “Has General Renato left for the palace already?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa deepened her questioning gaze. “‘General Renato’? You are home, love. You can call him Papá.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s gaze drifted off to the distance again. He looked down at the table and brushed his finger through the flour. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s questioning gaze changed to one of compassionate concern. “What is it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hesitated. “I… I dreamt about my real papa last night.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarisa’s expression then changed to one of understanding. She gave a gentle smile. “Alright,” she said in compassion. “You may call him ‘General Renato’ until you feel comfortable calling him ‘Papá’ again.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to remember your real papa,” she continued. “But always remember,” she gently placed a hand on his cheek and looked him in the eye, “Gabriel and I both love you as our own. Although I did not give you birth, and even though Gabriel is your commanding general, you are our son.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon placed a hand on Clarisa’s and gave a small smile. “Gracias, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Ese es mi hijo.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              She ruffled his hair with her flour covered hand, making flour fly everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              “¡Ay no!” she exclaimed. “I have already made a mess, but now I have it all over you!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a small chuckle. “It’s alright, Mamá.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have two more loaves to bake. Get yourself cleaned up and they will be ready before you need to leave.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod. Once a week she would bake bread for Gabriel’s squadron of knights, and Eamon would bring the fresh bread with him when he returned to the castle for his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eat your breakfast first,” She said pointing to the plate on the far end of the table, where there was less flour. “You will need your energy for today. Princess Phoena’s birthday celebration will be a big event.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s expression returned to his regular solemnity as he thought about returning to the castle and his duties. The fourteenth birthday celebration for the princess would be a big event, but he was not looking forward to it. Granted, it would be the most exciting thing that would happen ever since he became the princess’s personal guard two years before, but every day seamed to be the same as all the other days. He would guard the princess from any threat against her, which was no threat at all. He felt more like a nursemaid than a knight, and sticking by her side all day while she was pampered for her party would not help bring any excitement to his day.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t understand,” he said more to himself. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is that?” Clarisa asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes Father,” the princess called back. Turning to the children she said, “Thank you for letting me play with you. It was fun. I will see you later.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena joined her father, Eamon followed at a respectful distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the day, Eamon followed the king and princess as they visited several of their subjects. As they visited the families, Phoena played with the children while the king talked with the parents. They called upon merchants and discussed how business was, the king taking notice of any concerns the merchants might have. They even went to the town livery and helped clean out the stables. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stayed on his guard all the while, but he did not find any threats to the king or the princess. Of course he was glad that no one seemed hostile to them, but he couldn’t help but wish for a little action. Still, he wondered why he was there. If the people loved them so much, why would the king be concerned about bringing a body guard for his daughter. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the day was ending and they made their way back to the castle, Princess Phoena again stuck her head out of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That was so much fun!” she said to Eamon. When he did not respond, she asked, “Did you not think it was fun?” He still said nothing. “Come on, you are only two years older than me. You must know what fun is.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon did not move, but inside he cringed. He did not know what normal fun was. As far back as he could remember, he could not recall any instance of fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” King Titus said, “let Sir Ardal be. He is focusing on his duty right now.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “He can’t have fun while on duty?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” the king said firmly, letting her know the conversation was over.
            </p>
            <p>
              She sat back down in her seat with a little slump.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they were back at the castle, King Titus thanked Eamon for joining them. “I am grateful for your diligent work. Well done.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was an honor, Sire,” Eamon said with a slight bow. “I look forward to my new assignment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled. “New assignment? I’m afraid there will not be a new assignment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was confused and crestfallen. “I beg your pardon, Sire?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The assignment I gave you is a permanent assignment. I am sorry if I was not clear when I gave it to you. You were not just assigned to guard my daughter today. You are to be her guardian at all times.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was shocked. “I mean no disrespect, Sire, but I am capable of so much more. You have seen me in training. You know what I can do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled gently. Placing a hand on the young knight’s shoulder and looking him straight in the eye he said, “I do know that you are very capable. That is why I assigned you to be Phoena’s guardian. It is important to me, and I can only assign it to someone I can trust. You are noble and loyal. I know of no one better for this position.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon did not know what to say. He was honored that the king placed so much trust in him, but he still did not see the value of the position. He had skills that he could use doing so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sire,” was all Eamon said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He gave a bow. King Titus nodded with a smile then turned and left. Eamon stood alone for a while, still unsure of what to think.
