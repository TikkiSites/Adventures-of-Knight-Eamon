            <p>
              Eamon looked behind him. There was no sign of anyone following. Eamon was a bit disappointed and worried about that. He was sure his Papá would have sent some knights to find the princess. Surely they would have caught up with them by now. Eamon did not wake Phoena or Vanessa in hopes to keep the distance between them and any search party small. Vanessa, on the other hand, naturally woke up early, even before the sun rose, and hastened the group. It was as if she expected a search party as well, but did not want them to catch up. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was true what Phoena said, he was finally on a true adventure. It was something he had longed to do for a long time. He couldn’t help feeling a thrill of excitement, but he knew it was not the right way to do things. He was hoping knights would come and convince Phoena not to do this, or at the very least have more knights come to protect her if there was danger. He would do everything he could to protect her, but he knew that if there was a great threat, he would not be able to do much by himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              They rode another full day. When Eamon noticed Phoena getting uncomfortable in her saddle, he suggested they rest, but Vanessa said they couldn’t and needed to continue on. Phoena then said that she was fine and didn’t need the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sun was about to set when Eamon said they should set up camp. Vanessa seemed bothered to not continue moving forward, but Eamon could tell Phoena was past the point of arguing, so they stopped for the night. She looked so tired.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Eamon started the fire, he listened closely to their surroundings and looked around. He still could not find any indication they were being followed. He was not sure what to think.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon rubbed his eyes as he stoked the fire.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are tired,” Vanessa said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m fine,” Eamon responded.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are not. Let me stand watch tonight. You need some sleep.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “She is right,” Phoena said. “You have been up for two days straight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “A knight of Orea has the stamina to go several days without sleep,” Eamon defended.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes. “Perhaps normally, but you have had a more relaxed post since you became a knight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon scowled slightly at her comment. True, he had felt the same, and he had often complained to his Mamá about not feeling important. But recently he had finally realized the importance of his duties and did not like anyone else talking negatively about them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa continued, “Besides, I don’t think it is a wise idea to try when there are others capable of covering your shift. You need rest if you want strength to protect Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked to Phoena. She gave a soft smile and a nod. “You need rest,” she agreed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon rubbed his eyes and sighed. “Fine,” he consented. “I can rest for a few hours, but then I can take the morning watch.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes again and shrugged. “I suppose some sleep is better than no sleep.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon still stayed as alert as he could before going to sleep. He heard the usual sounds of the forest, but nothing threatening. Nothing yet.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon sat straight up in a rush. Even through his sleep, he heard something. He looked at Vanessa. She looked at him and gave a nod, indicating she heard it too. They both looked in the direction of the sound. There was something rustling through the bushes. Eamon stood up slowly and cautiously. He gently shook Phoena’s shoulder to wake her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Princess Phoena,” he said in a whisper. “Stay quiet and move slowly.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What’s going on?” she asked quietly. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              “There is something in the bushes,” Eamon explained. “It could be a harmless animal, or it could be a predator. We must be ready for anything. I want you to stay close to me.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded but said nothing. She slowly stood up and stayed close to Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              He picked up his shield and sword and faced the direction of the rustling bush, but kept his ears sharp for anything else surrounding them. Their horses whinnied and fidgeted nervously. He heard growling from ahead and additional rustling from behind. He saw a glint from the fire reflect in the eyes of the creature in the bush.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Wolves,” Eamon hissed quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa pulled out a dagger from her belt and stood next to Eamon. “How many do you think there are?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon listened. “At least three,” he answered. “One ahead, one behind, and one to the left.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa scoffed quietly. “We can take them,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked at Vanessa’s dagger skeptically. “They’d have to get pretty close. Too close for comfort.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, the wolves pounced. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One pounced on Eamon’s horse, but the horse bucked wildly and threw it off. After hitting the ground, the wolf righted itself and growled angrily.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa just barely dodged the pounce from the one ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon spun around in time to block the wolf behind him from pouncing on Phoena. He stiffened his stance so when the wolf collided with his shield, he did not fall over.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wolves growled and circled threateningly.
            </p>
            <p>
              One pounced toward the horses again, clawing wildly. The horses kicked and pulled at the ropes tying them to the tree. The wolf whimpered as it slid across the ground after being struck by the back hooves of Phoena’s horse.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa ducked and dodged as her wolf pounced again. The wolf missed her arm but caught the end of her bonnet and some hair. She cried out as it yanked. She sliced the dagger toward it. It yelped and pounced away, limping.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other wolf pounced toward Eamon. He stumbled and fell down, dropping his sword. The wolf clawed at the shield. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eamon!” Phoena cried.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon arched his back in a bridge and pushed to the side, shoving the wolf off. The wolf tumbled to the ground and Eamon stood up swiftly. Hoping the fire would scare them off faster, he grabbed a stick from the fire and waved the flaming end at the wolf. The wolf growled and then scampered off back into the woods, its companions quickly followed, one of them hobbling on an injured leg, Vanessa’s bonnet still in its mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon breathed heavily while still standing his ground. He listened for any more, but the horses calmed, so he hoped they were safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena, gripping Eamon’s sleeve, suddenly tugged on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What’s wrong?” he asked urgently, turning around quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              She was looking away from him with a stunned expression, not one of terror, but more of shock. He looked to where she was looking. His jaw almost dropped.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, with an equal expression of surprise, was Vanessa. She looked back and forth between them, with a bit of guilt in her expression. With the bonnet gone, they could now see what was underneath. Under her fiery locks, her ears curved up to fine points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa was an elf.
            </p>
