              The night was dark, clouds covering any light from the moon and stars. An infant slept soundly in a cradle. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A shadowed figure appeared, looming over the cradle. But as the shadow drew closer, the cradle seemed to glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow glowered. “You do not belong here,” it’s wispy voice whispered. Then with a leer it added, “But that will be resolved soon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow reached toward the child. As it’s hand grew closer, the light intensified. Suddenly the light was blinding and shot the shadow’s hand away with an echoing hum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow writhed in pain and the infant’s parents awoke. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When the father saw the shadow, he drew his sward that sat next to his bed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shadow was still for only a moment before it slipped away. As it vanished, it said in a menacing voice, “Someday your child will be mine. And all that the child holds will belong to me!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The father was out of bed, swinging the sward where the shadow was. But it was gone. The room was silent. The cradle no longer glowed, the infant still sleeping soundly. But the parents would not sleep for the rest of the night.
