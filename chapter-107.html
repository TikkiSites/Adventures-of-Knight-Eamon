            <p>
              Eamon walked down the hall beside Princess Phoena. She normally would skip, but after the long night of talking with and helping the refugees, she was exhausted. Her eyes showed how tired she was, but she still stood straight and walked regally. Her dress was dirty and her hair was a mess from letting little girls play with it, but her lips were curled in a pleased smile.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “I’m sorry for the misfortune everyone experienced, but I’m happy to help the people of Solaris. There were so many people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena inspected his face with an expression that looked slightly concerned. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Is something wrong, Princess?” Eamon asked, only raising his brow slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena rolled her eyes in a playful manner. “Yes,” she said annoyed. “You are still calling me Princess. One would think after two years you would know to call me Phoena. Just Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eamon shook his head slightly with bemusement. “Alright. Is something wrong, Phoena?” he emphasized. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Not anymore,” she said with a smile. She said nothing more, and Eamon found himself wondering what her inspecting gaze was about. But he did not push further.
            </p>
            <p>
	            When they arrived at Phoena’s quarters, a handmaid waited next to another guard.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good evening, Phoena,” she said. “Shall I draw your bath?”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena gave a stretch and said, “No thank you. I am so tired, I plan to go straight to bed. I can clean up in the morning.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Very well,” the handmaid said.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena turned to Eamon and gave him a warm smile. “Thank you, Sir Eamon for another great day.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon gave a nod to Phoena’s traditional night farewell. “Good night, Prin…, Phoena. Happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            She smiled and went into her room. The handmaid followed.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon took his place next to the other knight. Each night the King assigned four knights to guard Phoena’s room, two outside the room, and two out on the terrace. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus and General Renato arrived and walked up to Eamon and the other guard. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardel,” the king said. “It has been a long day. General Renato can arrange another knight to stand in for you tonight.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sire,” Eamon said with a bow. “It has not been a difficult day. My relief will come in four hours. I can make it until then.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled. “Very well.” He patted his shoulder and smiled. “I appreciate the diligent work you do.” He paused only a moment before adding, “With several new guests staying at the castle, I will want added precautions. I trust that the villagers seek no harm to my daughter, but one can never be too careful. Stay extra alert tonight.” 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon and the guard nodded in understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “General Renato will give you a run-down of the plan for the next few days. I am going to say good night to my daughter.”            
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Thank you, Sire,” Eamon and the other knight said in unison as they both gave bows.
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus smiled and walked up to his daughter’s door and gave a knock. The handmaid opened it.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Your Majesty,” she said with a small curtsy. “You are just in time.” She opened the door to let him in. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Before entering, he informed Eamon, “I will be exiting by way of the terrace tonight, so don’t expect me to come out this way. I would like some fresh air before retiring tonight.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good to know,” Eamon said. “Thank you, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus patted Eamon on the shoulder one more time and said with a smile, “Good night.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good night, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            After King Titus entered the room, the handmaid closed the door and went back to the washroom to finish some final duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus walked through the small entryway and turned to the bedchamber where Phoena sat on the chest at the end of her bed. A book rested in her lap, but she was not reading. She stared off with a tired expression. When he walked in, she woke up enough to greet him. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Papa!” she said, getting up from the chest and giving him a hug.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Quite an eventful day, wasn’t it?” Titus said, giving his daughter a kiss on the top of her head. “Not the birthday celebration we had planned for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a tired shrug. “Yes, well, no one could have expected it. But it was still a good birthday. I’m glad to have spent it helping our people.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus smiled softly at his daughter. “I am touched with the sacrifice you gave today. The people are lucky to have such a compassionate princess, and I am blessed to have such a loving daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena smiled up at him. “I learn from the best.” She gave him another big hug.
            </p>
            <p>
	            After holding the embrace for a moment, Titus said, “I will not keep you any longer from the rest you deserve. Have a wonderful night, my little angel. Happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Thank you, Papa. You as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              After tucking her into bed, he gave her one last kiss and walked to the terrace door. As he passed through, the guards on the other side only turned their heads for a moment to see who was exiting the room, then they continued their normal stance at attention. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Stay extra alert tonight,” the king repeated the instructions to these guards. “Good night,” he said as he walked down the terrace. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good night, Sire,” the guards said in unison. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus breathed in the night air deeply as he strolled the small walkway of the terrace, deep in thought. Something about the events of the day seemed off to him. He could not quite figure out what it was. 
            </p>
            <p>
             	Almost absentmindedly, he reached into his vest pocket and pulled out a small necklace charm of a white lily. He fingered it gently as he studied the shapes of the petals and thought deeply about his departed wife. The events of the day had brought back painful memories. He furrowed his brow in pain and clasped the charm tightly in is hand as the memory of her final day played through his mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus stopped walking for a moment and leaned on the railing of the terrace, looking out to the town below. But what he saw was not what was there. What he saw were horrifying memories. The memory of the blinding flash still burned his eyes. When the flash vanished, his wife was gone. He raised his clenched fist to his brow as tears rolled down his cheeks. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He opened his fist and looked again at the charm. He gave a small smile as he tried to console his thoughts with happy memories. He still had his daughter. She was the light and joy in his life. He would do anything to protect her from harm. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He placed the charm back in his pocket. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He breathed deeply as he looked out once again to the town below. In deep thought he looked to the distant mountains. He furrowed his brown in concern as he thought about the information he had received that day. The thought of a dragon raid was absurd. Although, it was not impossible. If the Mother Dragon had awakened, why was he not informed? Why would the dragons of Lóng Hún go against their peaceful nature? 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Hundreds of questions filled the king’s mind, and he needed to find the answers.
