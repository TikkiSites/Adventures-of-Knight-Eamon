              Eamon walked down the hall beside Princess Phoena. She normally would skip, but after the long night of talking with and helping the refugees, she was exhausted. Her eyes showed how tired she was, but she still stood straight and walked regally. Her dress was dirty and her hair was a mess from letting little girls play with it, but her lips were curled in a pleased smile.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “I’m sorry for the misfortune everyone experienced, but I’m happy to help the people of Solaris. There were so many people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena inspected his face with an expression that looked slightly concerned. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Is something wrong, Princess?” Eamon asked, only raising his brow slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena rolled her eyes in a playful manner. “Yes,” she said annoyed. “You are still calling me Princess. One would think after two years you would know to call me Phoena. Just Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eamon shook his head slightly with bemusement. “Alright. Is something wrong, Phoena?” he emphasized. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Not anymore,” she said with a smile. She said nothing more, and Eamon found himself wondering what her inspecting gaze was about. But he did not push further.
            </p>
            <p>
	            When they arrived at Phoena’s quarters, a handmaid waited next to another guard.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good evening, Phoena,” she said. “Shall I draw your bath?”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena gave a stretch and said, “No thank you. I am so tired, I plan to go straight to bed. I can clean up in the morning.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Very well,” the handmaid said.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena turned to Eamon and gave him a warm smile. “Thank you, Sir Eamon for another great day.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon gave a nod to Phoena’s traditional night farewell. “Good night, Prin…, Phoena. Happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            She smiled and went into her room. The handmaid followed.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon took his place next to the other knight. Each night the King assigned four knights to guard Phoena’s room, two outside the room, and two out on the terrace. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus and General Renato arrived and walked up to Eamon and the other guard. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardel,” the king said. “It has been a long day. General Renato can arrange another knight to stand in for you tonight.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sire,” Eamon said with a bow. “It has not been a difficult day. My relief will come in four hours. I can make it until then.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled. “Very well.” He patted his shoulder and smiled. “I appreciate the diligent work you do.” He paused only a moment before adding, “With several new guests staying at the castle, I will want added precautions. I trust that the villagers seek no harm to my daughter, but one can never be too careful. Stay extra alert tonight.” 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Eamon and the guard nodded in understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “General Renato will give you a run-down of the plan for the next few days. I am going to say good-night to my daughter.”            
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Thank you, Sire,” Eamon and the other knight said in unison as they both gave bows.
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus smiled and walked up to his daughter’s door and gave a knock. The handmaid opened it.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Your Majesty,” she said with a small curtsy. “You are just in time.” She opened the door to let him in. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Before entering, he informed Eamon, “I will be exiting by way of the terrace tonight, so don’t expect me to come out this way. I would like some fresh air before retiring tonight.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good to know,” Eamon said. “Thank you, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus patted Eamon on the shoulder one more time and said with a smile, “Good night.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good night, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            After King Titus entered the room, the handmaid closed the door and went back to the washroom to finish some final duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus walked through the small entryway and turned to the bedchamber where Phoena sat on the chest at the end of her bed. A book rested in her lap, but she was not reading. She stared off with a tired expression. When he walked in, she woke up enough to greet him. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Papa!” she said, getting up from the chest and giving him a hug.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Quite an eventful day, wasn’t it?” Titus said, giving his daughter a kiss on the top of her head. “Not the birthday celebration we had planned for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a tired shrug. “Yes, well, no one could have expected it. But it was still a good birthday. I’m glad to have spent it helping our people.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus smiled softly at his daughter. “I am touched with the sacrifice you gave today. The people are lucky to have such a compassionate princess, and I am blessed to have such a loving daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena smiled up at him. “I learn from the best.” She gave him another big hug.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some time of letting her father ponder in silence, Princess Phoena broke it with the question, “Papa, what does all this mean? I thought the dragons of Lóng Hún were peaceful. Why are they suddenly active again and going against their nature?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am not sure myself,” Titus responded, gaze still on the distant wall and in deep thought. “If the dragons are active, that must mean the Mother Dragon has awakened—something that has been anticipated for over a century. It should be something to be happy about, but if this man’s story is true, I’m not sure that it is something to rejoice in.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do you think the man lied?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Titus gave a deep sigh. “I’m not sure. I believe he believes he saw a dragon, but it is hard to determine truth with so little information. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “But I suppose we must not worry about that at the moment,” the king changed the subject. “For now we must focus on what to do with these people. Whatever did happen, they have experienced a great misfortune. We must find some way to help them.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked into the distance for a brief moment, then said, “I am sure they are fatigued. We had a large banquet planned for tonight. We can cancel that and let the people of Solaris come and eat instead.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The King looked at his daughter with a pleased smile. “You would give up your birthday celebration to help these people?” he asked in sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” Phoena responded. “Their need is greater than my party.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled lovingly at his daughter. “You are a loving and generous girl. You will make a great queen someday.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              A large crowd gathered in the great hall and started taking seats at the tables. The population of the village was not large, but it filled the large room and even overflowed outside. Everyone was covered with dirt from their long travel. Some people showed obvious signs of discomfort, not wanting to sit in the clean chairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The King and princess made their way around the room, greeting the people and helping them feel comfortable and welcomed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon followed the princess at a close distance. If anyone wanted to harm the princess, being in the large crowd would be the opportune time. However, he doubted anyone would want to. They all just simply wanted rest and sustenance. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena spoke gently to some children that were crying softly. “It will be alright. You are in a safe place now. You will receive some food shortly.” She hugged the children, not caring that the dirt caked on them rubbed off on her gown. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When she spoke with the adults, she grasped their hands and said, “I am sorry for your misfortune. We will do anything we can to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena and Eamon made their way through the room, they met King Titus as he spoke with the village leader, Loxias. The young woman with wild red hair was still with him, her hand on his arm in a supporting and comforting way.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Your highness,” they both said as Phoena approached. The girl gave a curtsy and the man nodded a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              “From what I hear, you gave up your birthday celebration to help us,” the old man said. “That was a generous sacrifice. Thank you.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena shrugged. “It was nothing. I’m just glad we already had a banquet planned so that we could feed your village.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “We do greatly appreciate it, Princess,” the young woman replied. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am happy to do it,” Phoena said. “Your name is Vanessa, correct?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, your highness.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena waved her hand. “Call me Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The girl smiled. “Very well, Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus turned back to Loxias and said, “The servants have prepared several visitor quarters to house some families. Unfortunately, we will not be able to house your whole village in the castle, but several people in town are willing to house families for the time being.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man gave a gasp of relief. “Thank you, Your Majesty.” He gave a bow of gratitude. “I am so thankful toward the town’s people for their help as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus patted the man’s shoulder. “We are happy to help. If you’ll excuse me, I must meet some more of your people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I should as well,” Phoena said. “I am always happy to meet more people. I can’t have too many friends, right?” She turned to Venessa, “It was a pleasure to meet you, despite the circumstances. I hope you enjoy your time here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Phoena,” Venessa said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, the princess turned to greet more guests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was about to follow the princess when Venessa tapped his arm. He turned to face her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a smile and said, “I have seen you with the princess, but I have never been introduced. May I ask your name?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hesitated, unfamiliar with this kind of situation. “I am Sir Ardel, personal knight for Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a surprised but friendly chuckle. “A knight? You look so young.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In defense Eamon stood a little straighter and said, “I am sixteen.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an apologetic smile. “I’m sorry. I did not mean any offence. I was just surprised that a young man of sixteen would already be a knight. You have accomplished much already in your youth. That is very honorable of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon, not used to being in a social situation, did not know how to respond. “Th-Thank you,” he stuttered in uncertainty. “If you will excuse me, I must return to the princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You can see her from here,” Venessa stated. “She is not far. Please, I just have a couple questions, then you can return to her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked back to the princess. There was no visible threat as she greeted the people. He gave a nod. “Alright, but I must watch the princess,” he said, not turning back to Vanessa.
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an amused chuckle. “Dedication. That is an honorable trait.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon could feel his cheeks burn just the slightest bit. He said nothing. He did not want to admit that he was never comfortable in a social setting. Yes, he did want to fulfill his duty in keeping watch on the princess, but he also felt awkward talking directly with someone in an unofficial way. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Anyway,” Vanessa said, “I couldn’t help but realize the sacrifice Princess Phoena has made. This was her special day, why would she give it up for us?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon thought deeply about the question before answering. “The Titus family have always been generous. They love their people and are always trying to find ways to help them.” As he spoke this, he realized how meaningful their visits to the town were to the people. Why would he have ever complained about going to town with them? It was an honorable thing to attended to the needs of the people with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “They even help those that are not in their kingdom when they can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt the inspecting gaze Venessa gave him. “As with you?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              In surprise, Eamon looked to Vanessa. She gave a smile and explained, “Ardel is not an Orean name. They helped you in some way and brought you here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked to the king. “King Titus took me in when I had no family to do so.” Then he corrected himself, “In truth, one of his knights took me in and adopted me, but it was King Titus that found me and helped me find the home I have now. For that, I will always be grateful and indebted to him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is why you became a knight so early on? Well, it is an honorable thing you do, and honorable people you serve.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She took a step back and added, “I will let you return to your duties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a nod as she walked away. 
            </p>
            <p>
              With the recent conversation fresh on his mind, Eamon looked at his duties in a brighter light. Even though Clarisa had told him many times before, he had not fully comprehended how honorable his responsibilities were. As he watched the king and princess attend to the people in need, he realized how special it was for him to work right beside them.

            <p>
              He watched as Princess Phoena bounced a toddler on her knee and spoke playfully to him to cheer him up. Her dress was now dirty form greeting all the weary travelers, but she gave no mind to it. She thought nothing about herself. Why couldn’t he do the same? As he watched the cheerful disposition of the princess, the slightest smile curled his lips.
