          </div>
          <div class="chapter-novel-paragraph">
            <p>
              Sir Eamon Ardal stood up straight beside the coach, waiting for the king and his daughter. He was not in full armor. A normal trip to town did not require it. But he wore a thick leather vest and had his sword sheathed at his side and his shield strapped to his back.
            </p>
            <p>
              The morning was cool, the sun barley rising. Mist drifted in from the nearby seashore. Savoring the peaceful moment, Eamon breathed in deeply. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon King Titus and Princess Phoena came, dressed in simple clothing. The king wore a regular tunic with brown trousers and heavy boots. The princess wore a brown vest with her white blouse and blue skirt. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Ardal.” King Titus said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon bowed his head in respect and acknowledgment. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Princess Phoena had a small skip in her step. “Good morrow, Sir Eamon,” she said with a joyful voice. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon almost cringed at the use of his first name. A knight was always called by his last name directly following his title. But the only movement he gave was another nod.
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess tilted her head and studied his face, her violet eyes piercing. “Will you not say anything?” she asked curiously. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, your highness,” Eamon stated simply. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She studied his face harder. “No smile? Where is your enthusiasm?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Don’t bother Sir Ardal, Phoena,” the king said. “You have enough enthusiasm for all of us,” he added with a laugh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The coachman opened the door for the king and princess. They entered the coach and Eamon mounted his horse. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While on the road to the town, Princess Phoena stuck her head out the window of the coach. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m so excited to go to town,” she said to Eamon. “I love our trips to visit the people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded in acknowledgement but said nothing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stayed silent and just listened as the princess continued talking all the way to town. The king smiled softly and shook his head gently. He knew Phoena would be excited; she always was when they would go to town, but she seemed extra talkative today. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When they arrived in town, several children ran alongside the coach excitedly. Several adults came to greet the king and princess. As King Titus exited the coach, he greeted the people humbly while shaking their hands and patting them on the shoulder. Several children ran up to the princess as the coachman helped her out. They jumped and giggled as they greeted her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon kept up his guard. Despite the happy faces around them, he knew that he needed to stay alert for anything. After all, why would the king ask him to come along if he did not suspect some kind of trouble. He watched carefully as the children pulled the princess to the open field to play. He followed them and stood by as the children began to chase each other. He scanned their surroundings but he did not see anything suspicious, yet he remained alert.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess turned to Eamon and said, “Come play with us, Sir Eamon!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprised, he looked to the princess and shook his head. “Thank you, but I cannot.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess gave him a disappointed look then returned to play with the other children.
            </p>
            <p>
              As he watched the children play, he felt a pinch of jealousy. The princess laughed as she played with the others. Eamon could not remember the last time he truly laughed out of delight. He had never had a normal childhood. Despite being royalty, the princess had a more normal childhood than even he had. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He shook his head to shake away these thoughts and feelings. He would not let himself get distracted. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After several minutes King Titus came to the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” he called out. “It is time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes Father,” the princess called back. Turning to the children she said, “Thank you for letting me play with you. It was fun. I will see you later.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena joined her father, Eamon followed at a respectful distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the day, Eamon followed the king and princess as they visited several of their subjects. As they visited the families, Phoena played with the children while the king talked with the parents. They called upon merchants and discussed how business was, the king taking notice of any concerns the merchants might have. They even went to the town livery and helped clean out the stables. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stayed on his guard all the while, but he did not find any threats to the king or the princess. Of course he was glad that no one seemed hostile to them, but he couldn’t help but wish for a little action. Still, he wondered why he was there. If the people loved them so much, why would the king be concerned about bringing a body guard for his daughter. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the day was ending and they made their way back to the castle, Princess Phoena again stuck her head out of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
              “That was so much fun!” she said to Eamon. When he did not respond, she asked, “Did you not think it was fun?” He still said nothing. “Come on, you are only two years older than me. You must know what fun is.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon did not move, but inside he cringed. He did not know what normal fun was. As far back as he could remember, he could not recall any instance of fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” King Titus said, “let Sir Ardal be. He is focusing on his duty right now.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “He can’t have fun while on duty?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” the king said firmly, letting her know the conversation was over.
            </p>
            <p>
              She sat back down in her seat with a little slump.
            </p>
            <p>
              When they were back at the castle, King Titus thanked Eamon for joining them. “I am grateful for your diligent work. Well done.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It was an honor, Sire,” Eamon said with a slight bow. “I look forward to my new assignment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled. “New assignment? I’m afraid there will not be a new assignment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was confused and crestfallen. “I beg your pardon, Sire?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The assignment I gave you is a permanent assignment. I am sorry if I was not clear when I gave it to you. You were not just assigned to guard my daughter today. You are to be her guardian at all times.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon was shocked. “I mean no disrespect, Sire, but I am capable of so much more. You have seen me in training. You know what I can do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king smiled gently. Placing a hand on the young knight’s shoulder and looking him straight in the eye he said, “I do know that you are very capable. That is why I assigned you to be Phoena’s guardian. It is important to me, and I can only assign it to someone I can trust. You are noble and loyal. I know of no one better for this position.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon did not know what to say. He was honored that the king placed so much trust in him, but he still did not see the value of the position. He had skills that he could use doing so much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Sire,” was all Eamon said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He gave a bow. King Titus nodded with a smile then turned and left. Eamon stood alone for a while, still unsure of what to think.
