            <p>
              Phoena paced the hallway, biting her lip in nervous thought. Sir Reginald watched, wide eyed. He couldn’t remember ever seeing her like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is something wrong, Princess?” he asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe it is nothing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is there anything I can do to help?”
            </p>
            <p>
              She paused her pace and smiled at him. “Thank you. I don’t think so. Maybe I’ll tell Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald smiled. He knew the princess did not mean anything personal by not telling him. Since she was a child, she had claimed Eamon was her best friend, even if Eamon was not aware of it himself. They grew up together from the time Phoena was a year old and General Renato brought Eamon to Orea. Clarisa, Renato’s wife, was Phoena’s nursemaid and would bring Eamon to the castle with her. As they grew, Phoena would always try to play with Eamon, but he was more reserved. When he was old enough to start knight training, she often would go to the fields to say hello. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though Eamon did not fully return her friendship so openly, he was the closest friend she had. Sir Reginald remembered her excitement when Eamon had become a full-fledged knight and was assigned to be her guard. He chuckled silently to himself at the memory. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After about thirty minutes of more pacing, the entryway opened and Sir Ardal and General Renato entered. The general had a large grin on his face, but Eamon, now officially on duty, kept his usual straight expression. Or, maybe it was his regular face all the time. Sir Reginald couldn’t remember if he had ever seen Eamon smile or laugh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Eamon!” Phoena called. She started to run toward him, but catching herself, she slowed down and finished her approach in a dignified walk. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s eyes widened in surprise at the beginning of her approach. “Is something wrong, Phoena?” he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled at the fact that he called her by name. “No, I don’t think so,” she said, briefly forgetting her concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” Sir Reginald said, walking up to them. He and Eamon gripped forearms in a firm shake.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Reginald,” Eamon said. “Any concerns I should be aware of?” He obviously was referring to Phoena’s excited greeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing that I am aware of,” Sir Reginald smiled. “However, you may be informed soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon raised a brow briefly in confusion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena said, raising a hand to her brow in embarrassment. “I am sorry, Sir Reginald. It is just a concern that I don’t want to bother you with. Again, it is probably nothing. Besides, it is your day off now. I don’t want to bother you any longer when you should be spending time with your family.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I understand Princess,” he said with a smile. “But just know, you are never a bother. I am honored to serve you.” He placed his hand over his heart and gave a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Thank you, Sir Reginald.” She curtsied.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Sir Reginald said with gusto. “As you said, I am off duty now. And I promised my daughter a birthday picnic.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena grinned. “Of course. I wish your daughter a happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Princess.” With that, Sir Reginald saluted Eamon and General Renato and left. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              General Renato then gave his respects and left to return to his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon turned to Phoena and said, “May I ask what that was about?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena blushed a bit in embarrassment. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I have just had some things on my mind that I want to express. I feel you would understand a little more, so I just got excited when you came in. I’ve been waiting since last night to let it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon fixed his eyes on hers, giving his full attention. “You can tell me,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled gently at his sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’ve been a little worried about Vanessa,” she said. “I fear she still may be upset with me about the new refugees.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That was two days ago,” Eamon said, furrowing his brow slightly. “Was she hostile to you yesterday?” Eamon felt some discomfort that he was not with the princess the day before. If anyone was unkind to her, he wished he would have been there to defend her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh, no!” Phoena answered quickly. “No. She was fine. She even laughed with me at one point in the day. It’s just, she was super quiet last night, hardly talking at all. It was as if something was on her mind, but she didn’t want to share.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon rested his brow a little, relieved that no one had threatened the princess. He almost gave an encouraging smile as he said, “You have not known her long. Even though you have expressed friendship to her early on, this is still a new experience for her. It is also a traumatizing time right now. Her village was attacked, and now another one has been as well. It will take time before she is ready to open up and express what is on her mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled again. “You are right. I must be more understanding and patient with her.” Phoena slightly blushed as she thought, <i>and with you</i>. She still felt concerned about how Eamon was handling everything. She feared he may never open up to her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where is Vanessa now?” Eamon asked. “I thought she would be with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena tilted her head in uncertainty. “That is the other thing. She never showed up for her morning duties. Another maid came and said Vanessa left the castle this morning. She didn’t say where she was going, just that she wouldn’t be back until after noon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon narrowed his eyes. “That is peculiar. Come to think of it, when General Renato and I stopped by the kitchen to drop off Mamá’s bread, the cook said that there were several loaves he had baked yesterday that were missing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow deep in thought. “If she was going to be gone for just a morning, why would she steal several loaves of bread?” She stammered, “…if it was her that took them.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              After a moment her eyes widened. “Of course! Last evening, we went to check on the refugees. She seemed upset about them not having very much food. That is when she started being silent. She must be going to the refugee camp to distribute bread!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon narrowed his eyes in thought. “I suppose that could be it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We must go there now!” Phoena said excitedly. She grabbed Eamon’s hand and began to pull him outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Wait, Phoena,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              She paused and quickly let go of his hand. “I’m sorry,” she said, her cheeks turning deep pink. “I got ahead of myself again. You are right; I need to let Otis know first that I will be missing another day of tutoring.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, I suppose that was close enough to what I was going to say,” Eamon said, slightly awed that she practically read his mind. “I was going to say that you should at least check with him first. But also, if that is what Vanessa is doing, she obviously wants to do it alone. Why not give her some time to think things through.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow. “I suppose you are right.” She looked up at him almost in pleading and added, “But I want to be there for her. How can she open up to me if I don’t join her in helping others? I want to show that I will always be there for her. I know I barely know her, but I feel a kinship with her somehow. I do not want to betray that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon thought about his papá telling him about finding a kindred spirit within King Titus and supporting him when he needed it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon sighed. “Alright,” he said. “If that is what you want to do, then I will be there beside you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Thank you.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              After a little arguing with Otis about missing more tutoring, Phoena won by convincing him that the best way to serve her people was to actually serve them and not spend all day reading the history of those who are dead. He was reluctant but figured she was right and allowed her to go, so long as she stayed to study the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena decided they would go to the town market before going outside the city walls to the camp. There were some refugees camped there, and she figured she’d check on them first. She also thought she could get some more supplies to give out to the refugees. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As they rode to the town, Phoena was quiet for a while. Eamon did not think much about it until he saw her glance at him with a concerned look.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is it?” he asked, turning his head to face her.
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an awkward, guilty smile. “You know how I am concerned about Vanessa not opening up to me about her thoughts?”
            </p>
            <p>
              He nodded and waited for her to continue. It was a moment before she did, as if mustering up courage to ask.
            </p>
            <p>
              “How have <em>you</em> been handling all this?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon widened his eyes in surprise. Although it made sense why she would ask. She knew his history. If she showed concern for a stranger, why would she not show concern for someone she had known her whole life?
            </p>
            <p>
              When he did not answer, Phoena stumbled awkwardly, “I…I understand if you don’t want to share. It is a personal matter. You do not have to tell me if you do not want to. I…I just wanted to be sure you are doing alright.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He gave a small, brief smile. “Thank you, Phoena.” He paused a moment before answering. “Honestly, I am handling it better than I would have thought.”  
            </p>
            <p>
              She glanced at him in curiosity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “To tell the truth,” he continued, “I did actually have a dream about the day my village was attacked the night before the first refugees came.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow. “Curious,” was all she said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was surprised to hear about a dragon attack, and the vague memories I have did run through my head. However, the thoughts did not trouble me much. The event was in the past. Yes, it was traumatizing at the time, but I have moved on. I found a new life here in Orea, and a new family. From it, I have found purpose.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked to Phoena. “I have purpose.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled softly. “Well, I am sure… no, I <em>know</em> you would still have purpose if you had stayed in Tearmann.” She blushed a little as she added, “But I am glad you are here. I’m glad you have found a purpose to be in Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He nodded. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Their conversation ended there as they reached the north gate to the city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              They worked their way through the market and Eamon guided their horses as Phoena talked with the villagers and refugees. They even ran into Sir Reginald and his wife and daughter as they headed toward a field for their picnic. Phoena wished the girl a happy birthday, to which the little girl giggled in excitement. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Look!” Phoena pointed after some time. “There she is.”
            </p>
            <p>
              On a bench by a cobbler shop sat Vanessa. She was giving a small loaf of bread to the man sitting next to her, a hand on his shoulder in a consoling manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena and Eamon approached slowly, Phoena remembered this time to not let her excitement make her rush.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am sorry for your loss,” they heard her say to the man. “I cannot imagine what you must be suffering.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She looked up as she noticed Phoena and Eamon approach. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Princess!” she said in slight surprise. “Sir Ardal.” She stood up and curtsied as she added, “I am sorry I did not show for my duties this morning. I only wanted to help these people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena rested a hand on her shoulder. “I understand. But next time just tell me and we can come together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Thank you, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena raised an eyebrow at her, “Princess?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa chuckled. “Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled and then turned her attention to the man sitting on the bench. “Hello sir,” she greeted. “What is your name?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am Jerzyr,” he said. His eyes looked weary and his countenance was somber. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to meet you,” Phoena said. She stretched out her hand in greeting. The man did not take it. Instead, he just looked down at the bread in his hand and fingered it gloomily, his farmer’s cowl covering his face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa put a hand on Phoena’s shoulder and gave her a somber expression. “This has been hard on him,” she said quietly. “He lost everything in the attack. He was willing to open up to me, but I don’t think he wants to retell his story.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded in understanding. “It was good to meet you, Jerzyr. If you need anything, I am happy to help in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up somberly. “Thank you, Highness. I will remember that.” Then he looked back down at his bread.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they walked away, Vanessa quietly explained, “He is a farmer just outside the village that was attacked. All his crops were burned in the attack.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is terrible,” Phoena said somberly. She looked to the distance, deep in thought. “I wish there was something more I could do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a small nod. “I am headed toward the camp, if you want to join me,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a small smile. “Yes. At least I can be here for these people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As they left the east city gates and rode toward the refugee camp, Vanessa and Phoena were both somber and quiet. Eamon, however, was extra alert. They were outside the city walls and he wanted to be sure that no surprises jumped out at them. He doubted this would happen, but with all the events that were happening, he did not want to let down his guard, especially since they were out of the city’s protection. 
            </p>
            <p>
              They visited around, listening to anyone who wanted to release the fear they were holding and giving bread and fruit to families that had nothing else. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As they headed back to the city, Eamon noticed Phoena trying to hold back some tears.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” he said, riding up to her. She blinked and gave a weak smile. “Don’t try to hide your feelings,” he said. “You wanted us to open up to you. I will respect it if you don’t want to express what you are feeling to me, but do not let it well up inside you. It is alright to cry.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes teasingly. “This from the boy who never expresses any emotion.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon furrowed his brow slightly, more from annoyance that she had called him a <em>boy</em> than that she teased him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then Vanessa changed to a serious expression. “But he is right. Let it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, Phoena burst out in a deep cry, bringing her horse to a stop.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is terrible what has happened to these people,” she wailed. “They have lost their homes, their livelihoods. Some of them even lost family members!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa furrowed her brow and closed her eyes in deep sorrow, but Eamon thought that maybe he saw anger in her expression as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I cannot just sit by and watch them suffer!” Phoena continued. “I want to do something more for them than just wait for everything to be okay. But I don’t know what I can do.” She hunched over and wept into her hands. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon moved his horse close enough to put a hand on her shoulder. She twitched at the unexpected gesture, but did not swipe his hand away.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were all quiet for a moment until Vanessa broke the silence. “I have an idea,” she said softly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena raised her head out of her hands to look at her and waited.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have been stewing over it myself since last night,” she began. “I think we should go to check out the village.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What?!” Eamon exclaimed. “We cannot do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave him a hard look. “Why not? No one else is going. If she wants to do something for these people, what is the harm of her checking their homes to see if they can return?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is the possibility of danger,” Eamon said emphatically. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What danger? The attack is over. There is nothing the dragons could want from an empty village.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. “Why do you think they send scouts instead of just sending the villagers back? Because there might still be lingering danger.” He waved his arm, gesturing toward Phoena, “And I have made a vow to keep the princess from harm.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes. “Then come with us and protect her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is not how it works!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena’s eyes widened at the sudden argument that was erupting before her. She had never seen Eamon so expressive, and she was stunned by it.
            </p>
            <p>
              “To ‘keep her from harm’,” he continued, “means that I do not knowingly bring her into danger and then protect her. It means that if I know something is dangerous, I do not bring her near it!”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We do not know that there will be any danger,” Vanessa said again. “For all we know, the most dangerous thing she will face will be a mosquito. Are you so emphatic about your duty to keep her from doing something that she feels is right?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “She never said it was the right thing to do. Personally, I don’t think it is. At least not the right way to do it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Then how would you do it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Enough!” Phoena shouted. “If you bicker any more, you will scare our horses into a wild run, then we <em>all</em> will be in danger.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Only then did Vanessa and Eamon realize that all three horses were fidgeting anxiously. They both became silent. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Phoena said calmly. “I was getting agitated too.” She turned to Vanessa. “Eamon is right, there is a possibility of danger.” Turning to Eamon she added, “But Vanessa is right as well. It is at least something I can do for these people. When they have suffered so much, why can’t I risk something to help them?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked intently at Phoena, his brows furrowed and eyes narrow in worry. “Phoena,” he said gently. “I promised your father I would keep you safe.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena sat silently for a moment, entranced by his unusually expressive face. She always felt his sincerity when he spoke to her, but something about this moment seemed more real. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled gently and answered, “I know you mean well. I know you will do anything to keep your word. That is why I am not worried about going. So long as you are there, I know I will be safe.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon furrowed his brow. “You have made up your mind then.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He sighed. “I do not agree with this. Your father will most likely put me in the stockade when we get back.” He looked her in the eyes and said, “But I will be there beside you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She nodded with a grateful smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Great,” Vanessa said. “Let’s leave now. We have several supplies from the leftover handouts, and we don’t want to face anyone else telling us not to do it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena suddenly had a rush of panic. “But we must tell someone. When we do not return, they will be worried.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Alright,” Vanessa said. “We will go back to town just to give a letter to a messenger. But then we will leave before anyone asks anything of us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked at her skeptically. “I do not agree with that plan.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes again. “Do you want to have more arguments with courtiers that will force her to stay?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “If that is what will happen, then I am fine with that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No, Eamon,” Phoena said. “She is right. I cannot let them lock me in my room and force me to do nothing. We must leave now.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a reluctant nod. “If that is what you feel is best, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena felt a little sting as he called her “Princess”. She let it go and emphatically said, “Yes. That is what I feel.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon furrowed his brow slightly with disappointment. After a moment of silence, he pointed out, “We do not have a map with us. We would need to go back to the palace anyway.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa pulled a roll of parchment out of her saddlebag. “Don’t we?” she asked a bit smugly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s brow furrowed deeper. “Where did you get that? Did you steal it from the palace library?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes. “No,” she said. “If you remember, I came from a distant village as well. We had a map to guide us to Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “So then, you stole it from Loxias.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “N…no,” Vanessa stammered, a slightly guilty expression on her face. “I am borrowing it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon pinched the bridge of his nose again. “Fine. If you both are set on doing this, I suppose there is no point in arguing.” He pointed a finger at Vanessa accusingly. “But I will not tolerate any more theft. You stole the map as well as bread from the royal kitchens. Even with good intentions, that behavior is not acceptable. I expect you to pay for the things you took.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a nod in respect. “I understand, and I intend to.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon kept his glare on her for a few seconds more before they kicked their horses to continue back to the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              After they sent a boy in the city to the castle with a note, they quietly slipped back out the east gates. They acted as if they were going back to the refugee camp, but once they were out of sight from the guards at the gate, they slipped toward the direction of the burned down village. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I hope you know what you are getting into, Princess,” Eamon said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The title stung once again, but Phoena pretended it did not phase her. Instead, she gave a mischievous smile and said, “I am starting on a true adventure. I thought that is what you have longed for, so I don’t see why you are complaining.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon gave a quiet grunt, but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena suddenly paused her horse, her face turning white.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is wrong?” Eamon asked urgently. “Have you changed your mind?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a weak smile, and trying to sound humorous said, “I feel I will be in greater danger when I return home. Otis will be mad that I am missing more tutoring sessions.” 
            </p>
