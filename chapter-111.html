            <p>
              Phoena paced the hallway, biting her lip in nervous thought. Sir Reginald watched, wide eyed. He couldn’t remember ever seeing her like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is something wrong, Princess?” he asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe it is nothing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is there anything I can do to help?”
            </p>
            <p>
              She paused her pace and smiled at him. “Thank you. I don’t think so. Maybe I’ll tell Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald smiled. He knew the princess did not mean anything personal by not telling him. Ever since she was a child, she had claimed Eamon was her best friend, even if Eamon was not aware of it himself. They grew up together, anyway, ever since Phoena was a year old and General Renato had taken Eamon back to Orea. Clarisa, Renato’s wife, was Phoena’s nursemaid and would bring Eamon to the castle with her. As they grew, Phoena would always play around Eamon, although he was more reserved. When he was old enough to start knight training, she often would go to the fields to say hello. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though Eamon did not fully return her friendship so openly, he was the closest friend she had. Sir Reginald remembered her excitement when Eamon had become a full-fledged knight and was assigned to be her guard. He chuckled silently to himself at the memory. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After about thirty minutes of more pacing, the entryway opened and Sir Ardal and General Renato entered. The general had a large grin on his face, but Eamon, now officially on duty, kept his usual straight expression. Or, maybe it was his regular face all the time. Sir Reginald couldn’t remember if he had ever seen Eamon smile or laugh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Eamon!” Phoena called. She started to run toward him, but catching herself, she slowed down and finished her approach in a dignified walk. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s eyes widened in surprise at the beginning of her approach. “Is something wrong, Phoena?” he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled at the fact that he called her by name. “No, I don’t think so,” she said, briefly forgetting her concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” Sir Reginald said, walking up to them. He and Eamon gripped forearms in a firm shake.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Reginald,” Eamon said. “Any concerns I should be aware of?” He obviously was referring to Phoena’s excited greeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing that I am aware of,” Sir Reginald smiled. “However, you may be informed soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon furrowed his brow briefly in confusion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena said, raising a hand to her brow in embarrassment. “I am sorry, Sir Reginald. It is just some concerns that I don’t want to bother you with. Again, it is probably nothing. Besides, it is your day off now. I don’t want to bother you any longer when you should be spending time with your family.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I understand Princess,” he said with a smile. “But just know, you are never a bother. I am honored to serve you.” He placed his hand over his heart and gave a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Thank you, Sir Reginald.” She curtsied.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Sir Reginald said with gusto. “As you said, I am off duty now. And I promised my daughter a birthday picnic.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena grinned. “Of course. I wish your daughter a happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Princess.” With that, Sir Reginald saluted Eamon and General Renato and left. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              General Renato then gave his respects and left to return to his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon turned to Phoena and said, “May I ask what that was about?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena blushed a bit in embarrassment. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I have just had some things on my mind that I want to express. I feel you would understand a little more, so I just got excited when you came in. I’ve been waiting since last night to let it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon fixed his eyes on hers, giving his full attention. “You can tell me,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled gently at his sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’ve been a little worried about Vanessa,” she said. “I fear she still may be upset with me about the new refugees.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That was two days ago,” Eamon said, furrowing his brow slightly. “Was she hostile to you yesterday?” Eamon felt some discomfort that he was not with the princess the day before. If anyone was unkind to her, he wished he would have been there to defend her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh, no!” Phoena answered quickly. “No. She was fine. She even laughed with me at one point in the day. It’s just, she was super quiet last night, hardly talking at all. It was as if something was on her mind, but she didn’t want to share.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon rested his brow a little, relieved that no one had threatened the princess. He almost gave an encouraging smile as he said, “You have not known her long. Even though you have expressed friendship to her early on, this is still a new experience for her. It is also a traumatizing time right now. Her village was attacked, and now another one has been as well. It will take time before she is ready to open up and express what is on her mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled again. “You are right. I must be more understanding and patient with her.” Phoena slightly blushed as she thought, and with you. She still felt concerned about how Eamon was handling everything. She feared he may never open up to her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where is Vanessa now? Eamon asked. “I thought she would be with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena tilted her head in uncertainty. “That is the other thing. She never showed up for her morning duties. Another maid came and said Vanessa left the castle this morning. She didn’t say where she was going, just that she wouldn’t be back until after noon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon narrowed his eyes. “That is peculiar. Come to think of it, when General Renato and I stopped by the kitchen to drop off Mamá’s bread, the cook said that there were several loaves he had baked yesterday that were missing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow deep in thought. “If she was going to be gone for just a morning, why would she steal several loave of bread?” She stammered, “…if it was her that took them.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man smiled gently. “I know she would. I cannot think of a better home for this boy.”  
            </p>
            <p>
              The man smiled and knelt again before Eamon. “Would you like to come with me, Eamon? I will take good care of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He took off his gauntlets and reached out his hand and waited for the boy to take it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked at the hand then up to the man’s face. He caught his eyes. The man’s eyes looked sincere and kind. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While still looking at his face, Eamon reached out his hand and placed it in the man’s. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eamon,” a distant voice called. “Time to wake up, hijo.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon blinked his eyes several times as he propped himself up. General Renato stood beside him, a friendly smile on his face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You must have been having a good dream. It took a while to wake you.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon smiled. “It was a good dream.” Granted, dreaming of the memory of losing his father was sad, but the rest of his memory of when he became a part of the Renato family was pleasant. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Buenos días, Papá,” he added.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general smiled wider. “Good morning, son.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Eamon ate breakfast and observed the man and woman that took him in so long ago, he couldn't help but smile. They were good people, and he was happy to be a part of their family. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m glad I am able to walk with you today, hijo,” General Renato said as they made their way to the castle. Oftentimes he had to arrive at the castle much earlier than Eamon would. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am glad too,” Eamon said. “Tell me about when you and Mamá came to Orea,” he added after a moment. 
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato smiled. “I must have told you a thousand times.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I know. I just think it is timeless.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “All, right then.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Clarisa and I grew up together. We knew when we were teenagers that we would marry each other….”
            </p>
            <p>
              “¡Ay, Papá!” Eamon exclaimed. “Leave out the mushy stuff.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel laughed.  
            </p>
            <p>
              “After we were married,” he continued, “we wanted to travel the world. We traveled all over, one adventure after another. Until we came to Orea and met Alexander Titus. He was a young prince at the time and very adventurous himself. Although he was much younger than Clarisa and I, we knew we had found a kindred spirit and we became good friends quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Clarisa and I stayed in Orea for quite some time, and we were planning on leaving on our next adventure. We loved Orea and all the people, but we wanted to travel more….”
            </p>
            <p>
              “And then King Titus invited you to become a knight,” Eamon interrupted. “But there is more to the story. More to the reason why you stayed, isn’t there? Not just because you were friends and he made you a knight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel nodded with a soft smile. “Yes, there is. Alexander’s father died unexpectedly and Alexander was crowned king at a young age. The sorrow of losing his father along with the weight of an entire kingdom now resting on his shoulders was a great burden for him. His invitation to become a knight was more than an honor. It was a plea for us to stay. He needed friends that would help him bear the weight. Although we could not fully place ourselves in a yoke—shall we say?—with the new king, we were there to offer advice and opinions where we could.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon smiled in admiration at his adopted father. “You gave up further adventures to support a friend.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel laughed again. “In a way, I suppose. But not entirely. We still traveled a lot and had many adventures. It just wasn’t in the way we had originally planned.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              He ruffled Eamon’s hair. “Like you. If we hadn’t stayed, we wouldn’t have been blessed to raise a son like you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon laughed lightly at the playful gesture and pushed away playfully. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The thing is,” Gabriel continued, “you don’t have to travel to distant lands to have adventures.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon walked in thoughtful silence for a moment before Gabriel stopped and faced Eamon directly. He placed a hand on Eamon’s shoulder and looked into his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I know that the last couple years have not been what you had planned or expected. I know you expected more out of being a knight. I know you long to explore and go on adventures. I see a lot of me in you. Just know that you are where you need to be. No one can say what will happen next.” He added with a sly smile. “You never know. Adventure may be just around the corner.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He let go of Eamon and continued walking. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon had much to ponder. He knew there was something more to the reason why Gabriel had stayed. He figured it was deep loyalty to his friend. That is why he had asked to hear the story again. He felt he needed to hear Gabriel’s story as an example to him. He had been thinking deeply about his role as guardian to the princess since the first village of refugees arrived. His role was about much more than responsibility. It was about loyalty. He had made a vow of loyalty to the king, but it was even deeper than that. It was about loyalty to a friend. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up at his father as they continued walking. Gabriel was the most loyal man he had ever met. He showed loyalty to his friend and king, loyalty to a complete stranger he would one day call <em>son</em>, and loyalty to his people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hoped he could show that same loyalty. If he wanted to do that, he would have to show complete loyalty and devotion to his current duties: to King Titus and especially to Princess Phoena.
