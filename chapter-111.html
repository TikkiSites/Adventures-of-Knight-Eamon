            <p>
              Phoena paced the hallway, biting her lip in nervous thought. Sir Reginald watched, wide eyed. He couldn’t remember ever seeing her like this.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is something wrong, Princess?” he asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe it is nothing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Is there anything I can do to help?”
            </p>
            <p>
              She paused her pace and smiled at him. “Thank you. I don’t think so. Maybe I’ll tell Sir Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald smiled. He knew the princess did not mean anything personal by not telling him. Ever since she was a child, she had claimed Eamon was her best friend, even if Eamon was not aware of it himself. They grew up together, anyway, ever since Phoena was a year old and General Renato had taken Eamon back to Orea. Clarisa, Renato’s wife, was Phoena’s nursemaid and would bring Eamon to the castle with her. As they grew, Phoena would always play around Eamon, although he was more reserved. When he was old enough to start knight training, she often would go to the fields to say hello. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though Eamon did not fully return her friendship so openly, he was the closest friend she had. Sir Reginald remembered her excitement when Eamon had become a full-fledged knight and was assigned to be her guard. He chuckled silently to himself at the memory. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After about thirty minutes of more pacing, the entryway opened and Sir Ardal and General Renato entered. The general had a large grin on his face, but Eamon, now officially on duty, kept his usual straight expression. Or, maybe it was his regular face all the time. Sir Reginald couldn’t remember if he had ever seen Eamon smile or laugh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Eamon!” Phoena called. She started to run toward him, but catching herself, she slowed down and finished her approach in a dignified walk. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon’s eyes widened in surprise at the beginning of her approach. “Is something wrong, Phoena?” he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled at the fact that he called her by name. “No, I don’t think so,” she said, briefly forgetting her concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” Sir Reginald said, walking up to them. He and Eamon gripped forearms in a firm shake.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Sir Reginald,” Eamon said. “Any concerns I should be aware of?” He obviously was referring to Phoena’s excited greeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Nothing that I am aware of,” Sir Reginald smiled. “However, you may be informed soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon furrowed his brow briefly in confusion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena said, raising a hand to her brow in embarrassment. “I am sorry, Sir Reginald. It is just some concerns that I don’t want to bother you with. Again, it is probably nothing. Besides, it is your day off now. I don’t want to bother you any longer when you should be spending time with your family.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I understand Princess,” he said with a smile. “But just know, you are never a bother. I am honored to serve you.” He placed his hand over his heart and gave a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Thank you, Sir Reginald.” She curtsied.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Sir Reginald said with gusto. “As you said, I am off duty now. And I promised my daughter a birthday picnic.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena grinned. “Of course. I wish your daughter a happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Princess.” With that, Sir Reginald saluted Eamon and General Renato and left. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              General Renato then gave his respects and left to return to his duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon turned to Phoena and said, “May I ask what that was about?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena blushed a bit in embarrassment. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I have just had some things on my mind that I want to express. I feel you would understand a little more, so I just got excited when you came in. I’ve been waiting since last night to let it out.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon fixed his eyes on hers, giving his full attention. “You can tell me,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled gently at his sincerity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’ve been a little worried about Vanessa,” she said. “I fear she still may be upset with me about the new refugees.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That was two days ago,” Eamon said, furrowing his brow slightly. “Was she hostile to you yesterday?” Eamon felt some discomfort that he was not with the princess the day before. If anyone was unkind to her, he wished he would have been there to defend her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh, no!” Phoena answered quickly. “No. She was fine. She even laughed with me at one point in the day. It’s just, she was super quiet last night, hardly talking at all. It was as if something was on her mind, but she didn’t want to share.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon rested his brow a little, relieved that no one had threatened the princess. He almost gave an encouraging smile as he said, “You have not known her long. Even though you have expressed friendship to her early on, this is still a new experience for her. It is also a traumatizing time right now. Her village was attacked, and now another one has been as well. It will take time before she is ready to open up and express what is on her mind.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled again. “You are right. I must be more understanding and patient with her.” Phoena slightly blushed as she thought, and with you. She still felt concerned about how Eamon was handling everything. She feared he may never open up to her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where is Vanessa now? Eamon asked. “I thought she would be with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena tilted her head in uncertainty. “That is the other thing. She never showed up for her morning duties. Another maid came and said Vanessa left the castle this morning. She didn’t say where she was going, just that she wouldn’t be back until after noon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon narrowed his eyes. “That is peculiar. Come to think of it, when General Renato and I stopped by the kitchen to drop off Mamá’s bread, the cook said that there were several loaves he had baked yesterday that were missing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow deep in thought. “If she was going to be gone for just a morning, why would she steal several loave of bread?” She stammered, “…if it was her that took them.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              After a moment her eyes widened. “Of course! Last evening, we went to check on the refugees. She seemed upset about them not having a lot of food. That is when she started being silent. She must be going to the refugee camp to distribute bread!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon narrowed his eyes in thought. “I suppose that could be it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We must go there now!” Phoena said excited. She grabbed Eamon’s hand and began to pull him outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Wait, Phoena,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              She paused and quickly let go of his hand. “I’m sorry,” she said, her cheeks turning deep pink. “I got ahead of myself again. You are right, I need to let Otis know first that I will be missing another day of tutoring.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, I suppose that was close enough to what I was going to say,” Eamon said, slightly awed that she practically read his mind. “I was going to say that you should at least check with him first. But also, if that is what Vanessa is doing, she obviously wants to do it alone. Why not give her some time to think things through.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow. “I suppose you are right.” She looked up at him almost in pleading and added, “But I want to be there for her. How can she open up to me if I don’t join her in helping others? I want to show that I will always be there for her. I know I barely know her, but I feel a kinship with her somehow. I do not want to betray that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon thought about his papá telling him about finding a kindred spirit within King Titus and supporting him when he needed it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon sighed. “Alright,” he said. “If that is what you want to do, then I will be there beside you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She smiled. “Thank you.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              After a little arguing with Otis about missing more tutoring, Phoena won by convincing him that the best way to serve her people was to actually serve them, and not spend all day reading the history of those who are dead. He was reluctant but figured she was right and allowed her to go, so long as she stayed to study the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena decided they would go to the town market before going outside the city walls to the camp. There were some refugees camped there, and she figured she’d check on them first. She also figured she could get some more supplies to give out to the refugees. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As they rode to the town, Phoena was quiet for a while. Eamon did not think much about it until he saw her glance at him with a concerned look.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is it?” he asked, turning his head to face her.
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave an awkward, guilty smile. “You know how I am concerned about Vanessa not opening up to me about her thoughts?”
            </p>
            <p>
              He nodded and waited for her to continue. It was a moment before she did, as if mustering up courage to ask.
            </p>
            <p>
              “How have you been handling all this?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon widened his eyes in surprise. Although it made sense why she would ask. She knew his history. If she showed concern for a stranger, why would she not show concern for someone she had known her whole life?
            </p>
            <p>
              When he did not answer, Phoena stumbled awkwardly, “I…I understand if you don’t want to share. It is a personal matter. You do not have to tell me if you do not want to. I…I just wanted to be sure you are doing alright.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He gave a small, brief smile. “Thank you, Phoena.” He paused a moment before answering. “Honestly, I am handling it better than I would have thought I would.”  
            </p>
            <p>
              She glanced at him in curiosity. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “To tell the truth,” he continued, “I did actually have a dream about the day my village was attacked the night before the first refugees came.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow. “Curious,” was all she said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was surprised to hear about a dragon attack, and the vague memories I have did run through my head. However, the thoughts did not trouble me much. The event was in the past. Yes, it was traumatizing at the time, but I have moved on. I found a new life here in Orea, and a new family. From it, I have found purpose.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked to Phoena. “I have purpose.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled softly. “Well, I am sure… no, I know you would still have purpose if you had stayed in Tearmann.” She blushed a little as she added, “But I am glad you are here. I’m glad you have found a purpose to be in Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He nodded. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Their conversation ended there as they reached the north gate to the city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              They worked their way through the market and Eamon guided their horses as Phoena talked with the villagers and refugees. They even ran into Sir Reginald and his wife and daughter as they headed toward a field for their picnic. Phoena wished the girl a happy birthday, to which the little girl giggled in excitement. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Look!” Phoena pointed after some time. “There she is.”
            </p>
            <p>
              On a bench by a cobbler shop sat Vanessa. She was giving a small loaf of bread to the man sitting next to her, a hand on his shoulder in a consoling manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena and Eamon approached slowly, Phoena remembered this time to not let her excitement make her rush.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am sorry for your loss,” they heard her say to the man. “I cannot imagine what you must be suffering.”
            </p>
            <p>
              She looked up as she noticed Phoena and Eamon approach. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Princess!” she said in slight surprise. “Sir Ardal.” She stood up and curtsied as she added, “I am sorry I did not show for my duties this morning. I only wanted to help these people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena rested a hand on her shoulder. “I understand. But next time just tell me and we can come together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Thank you, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena raised an eyebrow at her, “Princess?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa chuckled. “Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled and then turned her attention to the man sitting on the bench. “Hello sir,” she greeted. “What is your name?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am Jerzyr,” he said. His eyes looked weary and his countenance was somber. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to meet you,” Phoena said. She stretched out her hand in greeting. The man did not take it. Instead, he just looked down at the bread in his hand and fingered it gloomily, his farmer’s cowl covering his face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa put a hand on Phoena’s shoulder and gave her a somber expression. “This has been hard on him,” she said quietly. “He lost everything in the attack. He was willing to open up to me, but I don’t think he wants to retell his story.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded in understanding. “It was good to meet you, Jerzyr. If you need anything, I am happy to help in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up somberly. “Thank you, Highness. I will remember that.” Then he looked back down at his bread.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they walked away, Vanessa quietly explained, “He is a farmer just outside the village that was attacked. All his crops were burned in the attack.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is terrible,” Phoena said somberly. She looked to the distance, deep in thought. “I wish there was something more I could do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a small nod. “I am headed toward the camp, if you want to join me,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a small smile. “Yes. At least I can be here for these people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As they left the south city gates and rode toward the refugee camp, Vanessa and Phoena were both somber and quiet. Eamon, however, was extra alert. They were outside the city walls and he wanted to be sure that no surprises jumped out at them. He doubted this would happen, but with all the events that were happening, he did not want to let down his guard, especially since they were out of the city’s protection. 
            </p>
            <p>
              They visited around, listening to anyone who wanted to release the fear they were holding, and giving bread and fruit to families that had nothing else. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As they headed back to the city, Eamon noticed Phoena trying to hold back some tears.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Phoena,” he said, riding up to her. She blinked and gave a weak smile. “Don’t try to hide your feelings,” he said. “You wanted us to open up to you. I will respect it if you don’t want to express what you are feeling to me, but do not let it well up inside you. It is alright to cry.”
