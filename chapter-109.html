            <p>
              Phoena walked down the hall, thinking about her Papa. It had been nearly a week since he left, and she missed him dearly. She knew he would still be much longer. She did worry for him. Despite what others’ thought, she was not so naïve. She understood the danger that he could possibly be walking into. She constantly prayed for his safe return.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Would you like to share what is on your mind?” Vanessa’s voice broke through her thoughts. She had been walking beside her all morning, but Phoena hardly acknowledged her. Eamon was also there, but he walked a slight distance behind. It was as if he knew what she would be thinking about and wanted to give her some extra space to show reverence for her worry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am sorry,” Phoena said. “I just miss Papa.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled gently and nodded. “I wish I could comfort you and say he will return soon, but Lóng Hún is far away. However, I am sure that we can keep busy enough that you will hardly know the difference.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled and nodded. “Perhaps. He always guided me on what to do as a leader, but I fear I don’t know what to do without him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You do not have to spend all your time doing royal work.” Vanessa said. “You also need time to relax and play a bit. You are still young. You should have some fun.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a light chuckle. “If only the life of a ruler were like that. I may be a young princess, but I must always serve my people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rocked her head back and forth, “I understand that, but you must also help yourself on occasion to refresh yourself.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked briefly to Eamon. His eyebrow was raised slightly, as if in curiosity of what “fun” was. He always took his responsibilities seriously—very seriously. She wasn’t even sure if he had ever laughed out of fun. But even he occasionally had a full day or two to rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave an unsure smile. “I’m not sure. Otis was going to tutor me on some state affairs today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Pfft,” Vanessa scoffed with a wave of her hand. “We can talk with him. I am sure he will understand the need for a rest day.” She put her hand next to her mouth and leaned over and added, “He might even enjoy a break himself.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a laugh, “With Papa gone, he has even more to do than usual. He gets less breaks than I do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Exactly,” Vanessa said. “I am sure he would appreciate one less thing to do today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow in thought. “I suppose. But what would I do today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We could go to the village,” Vanessa suggested. “I know you enjoy your visits there, and the people would love to see you. I’m sure they would enjoy a visit from you on a day where you don’t have to perform royal duties. Plus, you and I could see how my people staying in the village are doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You do have a point there,” Phoena said in thought. She looked  back to Eamon. He looked to her, waiting for her decision, but gave no indication of what he thought. It was his usual strait-faced expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You’re a lot of help,” Phoena said sarcastically. Eamon furrowed his brow the slightest bit as if in question, but quickly returned to his normal expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I suppose we could talk to Otis about it,” Phoena finally decided. “If he says ‘no’, I will stay here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” Vanessa said with a respectful bow of her head.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">

            </p>
            <p>
              The adviser was hesitant at first, but when Vanessa suggested that it could help Phoena get her mind off her father, he agreed that it would be wise for her to rest. Phoena didn’t think it would really take her mind off of her Papa, but at least she would be about doing something more than just studying all day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena went about the town with Eamon and Vanessa, she did enjoy herself. She always enjoyed her visits to the town. She loved her people, and seeing them always made her day better. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa enjoyed her time as well. Phoena could tell that she cared deeply for the people of Solaris and was happy to see her people recovering well from the dragon attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon, well, Phoena couldn’t tell exactly what Eamon felt about the trip to town. He still had his usual straight expression. She thought that maybe she saw him start to smile the slightest bit while she and Vanessa joined an old basket weaver on her latest project, but it was a fleeting moment. She tried to imagine him with a genuine smile and thought he would look quite handsome with a smile. Although he had never expressed anything out loud to her, she knew he longed to do more than just be her guardian. He was difficult to read, but she could at least tell that much. She understood why. She did not live an adventurous life, not one a knight would long for. Her most exciting moments were when she visited the people of the town. Though she enjoyed it greatly, she knew it was nothing like a knightly quest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, she was happy he was with her. He was not like any of the other knights. One thing was that she was happy to have someone close to her age to spend the day with. Despite his somber expressions, she felt there was so much more to him. She knew he was loyal and dedicated. He would do everything in his power to perform his duties well. That was not to say the other knights were not dedicated and loyal, they were, but something about Eamon made his dedication unique. He seemed more genuine, like there was a purpose to his loyalty. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena was enjoying her day off. Everything was so relaxing. Although she did still think about her father, she was able to find peace and let go of worry. Until suddenly, a ruckus came from the eastern gate. Several people murmured and cleared the way as a large group came through the gates. They were dirty and travel worn. Some looked like they had scorch marks on their clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Can someone please help us?” a man in the front shouted. “We seek an audience with the king. Who can we ask to inform him?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena ran over in a hurry. “What happened?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Our village was attacked by dragons,” the man said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gasped. “Your village too?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Was there another village attacked?” the man asked with worry. “This may be worse than we thought.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man looked past Phoena to Eamon as he rushed up behind her. Though Eamon did not wear a knight’s full uniform, the man recognized that his shield bore the Orean crest. “A knight of the realm, I presume?” The man nodded his head to Eamon in a respectful bow. “Please, sir knight, inform the king that we seek an audience.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You seek refuge?” Phoena assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, child,” the man said. “Our people have traveled far.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “My father is not here,” Phoena said, “but I can get you an audience with the council. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a small smile. As she turned to him, she said, “I know you wanted to join him as well. This could have been your chance to go on an adventure, a real quest. But you didn’t even ask.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt a slight blush of embarrassment. Was he that obvious? But with a straight face he said, “I do what the king commands me. He wishes me to stay and be your guardian. That is what I will do.” He added a bow to show his respect and the sincerity of his statement.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">

            </p>
            <p>
              The day deepened into early evening as the princess went to the guest hallways to check up on several of the refugees. Many stated they did not know what to do with themselves. They had no responsibilities that they were used to doing in their village. Some found time to visit with the castle staff, talking with maids as they tidied the rooms and dusted the halls. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena and Eamon walked down the hall, they came across Vanessa. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh, Your Highness,” she said. “I am so happy to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to see you as well,” Phoena said with a happy smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was hoping to talk with you about something of great importance.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena said unsure. “My father has left, so you will need to take up any concerns you have to his advisor, Otis.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is no concern,” Vanessa stated, correcting her urgent tone. “I was just hoping to speak with you about a position as your handmaid.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Oh,” Phoena said again. “ I would not ask that of you. I have handmaids and you are a guest.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I want to,” she said in sincerity. “You have shown my people great love and service. I would like to repay you in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled, “You do not need to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “But I want to,” Vanessa stated again. “I have talked with several servants throughout the castle, and they have told me of the respect you and your father show to all of them. They love serving you and I want to show that same gratitude.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you. But I have no say in that decision. Well, not the ultimate say. Only my father can staff the servants of the castle. Or his advisor who acts for him while he is away.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Then I would like to speak with Otis.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know,” Phoena said. “I am honored that you wish to do such a thing for me, but I cannot ask you to.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You did not ask. I am asking.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena was silent a moment, inspecting Vanessa’s face. “I suppose so. I can take you to Otis now.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “This will be fun!” Phoena stated as she helped Vanessa settle in her new handmaiden’s quarters. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all my handmaids. They are like family to me. But it will be fun having someone my age. It will be like having a sister!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa laughed. “I’m glad you are happy with this. I am a bit excited, too. I never had any siblings to care for. It will be a new adventure for me.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “So,” Phoena said interested?, “tell me about yourself. You mentioned you don’t have siblings. What about your parents? Did I meet them yesterday?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Vanessa hesitated with a shrug, “not exactly. My parents died when I was just a child. I kind of just wandered from family to family, staying in no particular place. You could say I was a nomad for a long time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow in sympathy. “I am so sorry. You don’t have to talk about it if it is a sensitive subject for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Thank you, but it is all right. I grew use to it. Eventually I found my way to Solaris and the people accepted me as one of their own, and Loxias and his wife took me in. I suppose they are the closest thing I ever had to parents.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled gently. “That is so nice. How long have you been with them?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “For about five years. They found me when I was ten. They treated me as if I was their own daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is wonderful. I have seen what caring people do when they take a child into their home and hearts.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You speak of Sir Ardel?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprised, Phoena asked, “How did you know?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “He mentioned it last night. I asked about his name—because it is not an Orean name—and he told me his story.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena blinked in shock. “I’m surprised he did that. He is not one for much conversation, and he never talks about his past.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a guilty shrug. “Well, he didn’t tell me much of his story. He just mentioned he was taken in by a knight in answer to a question I had. He didn’t say much else.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded. “That makes more sense. He keeps to himself a lot.” Her expression changed to a distant, concerned look. “Which concerns me. He is very stoic, but I’ve wondered how he has been handling these last two days, with all the events that have happened.”
            </p>
            <p>
              With an intrigued look, Vanessa asked, “Why do you say that?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena shifted uncomfortably. “If he did not tell you, I should not.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa narrowed her eyes in thought. “Does it have anything to do with the elven attack on Tearmann?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave her another surprised look. “Why would you assume that?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a nonchalant shrug. “I am not ignorant to the events in other kingdoms. It makes sense and the timing is right. First hint: his name. Ardel is a Miotasian name, and Tearmann was one of the few human villages in the kingdom. The attack happened thirteen years ago, so he would have been a young boy then. If his family did not survive the attack, it would make sense why he was taken in by another family. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The attack on Tearmann was led by Sheridan,” Vanessa continued, “the last Miotasian dragon. I can understand why you are concerned for Sir Ardel. A dragon attack must be bringing back terrible memories for him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are good,” Phoena said amazed by Vanessa’s deduction. “How do you know all this?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Being a nomad for most of my life, I hear stories. I also like to learn about the histories of other nations.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “So you have traveled a lot. Do you remember your original home at all?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa scrunched her brow in thought. “Not much. I remember it being very green and by a beautiful lake. That is all.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I can’t imagine not remembering my home,” Phoena said with a deep sigh. “I wonder how much Eamon remembers of his home. I fear all that he does remember is the attack.” She then looked to Vanessa with pleading eyes, “Please do not tell him I mentioned anything. I don’t want him to feel like I am invading his privacy. I also don’t want to open wounds by bringing up his past.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Don’t worry. You can trust me, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Please, it’s Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa nodded. “You can trust me, Phoena.”
