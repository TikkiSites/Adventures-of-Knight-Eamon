            <p>
              Phoena walked down the hall, thinking about her Papa. It had been nearly a week since he left, and she missed him dearly. She knew he would still be much longer. She did worry for him. Despite what others’ thought, she was not so naïve. She understood the danger that he could possibly be walking into. She constantly prayed for his safe return.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Would you like to share what is on your mind?” Vanessa’s voice broke through her thoughts. She had been walking beside her all morning, but Phoena hardly acknowledged her. Eamon was also there, but he walked a slight distance behind. It was as if he knew what she would be thinking about and wanted to give her some extra space to show reverence for her worry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am sorry,” Phoena said. “I just miss Papa.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled gently and nodded. “I wish I could comfort you and say he will return soon, but Lóng Hún is far away. However, I am sure that we can keep busy enough that you will hardly know the difference.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled and nodded. “Perhaps. He always guided me on what to do as a leader, but I fear I don’t know what to do without him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You do not have to spend all your time doing royal work.” Vanessa said. “You also need time to relax and play a bit. You are still young. You should have some fun.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a light chuckle. “If only the life of a ruler were like that. I may be a young princess, but I must always serve my people.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rocked her head back and forth, “I understand that, but you must also help yourself on occasion to refresh yourself.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked briefly to Eamon. His eyebrow was raised slightly, as if in curiosity of what “fun” was. He always took his responsibilities seriously—very seriously. She wasn’t even sure if he had ever laughed out of fun. But even he occasionally had a full day or two to rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave an unsure smile. “I’m not sure. Otis was going to tutor me on some state affairs today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Pfft,” Vanessa scoffed with a wave of her hand. “We can talk with him. I am sure he will understand the need for a rest day.” She put her hand next to her mouth and leaned over and added, “He might even enjoy a break himself.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a laugh, “With Papa gone, he has even more to do than usual. He gets less breaks than I do.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Exactly,” Vanessa said. “I am sure he would appreciate one less thing to do today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow in thought. “I suppose. But what would I do today.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We could go to the village,” Vanessa suggested. “I know you enjoy your visits there, and the people would love to see you. I’m sure they would enjoy a visit from you on a day where you don’t have to perform royal duties. Plus, you and I could see how my people staying in town are doing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You do have a point there,” Phoena said in thought. She looked  back to Eamon. He looked to her, waiting for her decision, but gave no indication of what he thought. It was his usual straight-faced expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You’re a lot of help,” Phoena said sarcastically. Eamon furrowed his brow the slightest bit as if in question, but quickly returned to his normal expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I suppose we could talk to Otis about it,” Phoena finally decided. “If he says ‘no’, I will stay here.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Of course,” Vanessa said with a respectful bow of her head.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The adviser was hesitant at first, but when Vanessa suggested that it could help Phoena get her mind off her father, he agreed that it would be wise for her to rest. Phoena didn’t think it would really take her mind off of her Papa, but at least she would be about doing something more than just studying all day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena went about the town with Eamon and Vanessa, she did enjoy herself. She always enjoyed her visits to the town. She loved her people, and seeing them always made her day better. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa enjoyed her time as well. Phoena could tell that she cared deeply for the people of Solaris and was happy to see her people recovering well from the dragon attack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon... well, Phoena couldn’t tell exactly what Eamon felt about the trip to town. He still had his usual straight expression. She thought that maybe she saw him start to smile the slightest bit while she and Vanessa joined an old basket weaver on her latest project, but it was a fleeting moment. She tried to imagine him with a genuine smile and thought he would look quite handsome with a smile. Although he had never expressed anything out loud to her, she knew he longed to do more than just be her guardian. He was difficult to read, but she could at least tell that much. She understood why. She did not live an adventurous life, not one a knight would long for. Her most exciting moments were when she visited the people of the town. Though she enjoyed it greatly, she knew it was nothing like a knightly quest. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, she was happy he was with her. He was not like any of the other knights. One thing was that she was happy to have someone close to her age to spend the day with. Despite his somber expressions, she felt there was so much more to him. She knew he was loyal and dedicated. He would do everything in his power to perform his duties well. That was not to say the other knights were not dedicated and loyal; they were, but something about Eamon made his dedication unique. He seemed more genuine, like there was a purpose to his loyalty. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena was enjoying her day off. Everything was so relaxing. Although she did still think about her father, she was able to find peace and let go of worry. Until suddenly, a ruckus came from the eastern gate. Several people murmured and cleared the way as a large group came through the gates. They were dirty and travel worn. Some looked like they had scorch marks on their clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Can someone please help us?” a man in the front shouted. “We seek an audience with the king. Who can we ask to inform him?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena ran over in a hurry. “What happened?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Our village was attacked by dragons,” the man said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gasped. “Your village too?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Was there another village attacked?” the man asked with worry. “This may be worse than we thought.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man looked past Phoena to Eamon as he rushed up behind her. Though Eamon did not wear a knight’s full uniform, the man recognized that his shield bore the Orean crest. “A knight of the realm, I presume?” The man nodded his head to Eamon in a respectful bow. “Please, sir knight, inform the king that we seek an audience.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You seek refuge?” Phoena assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, child,” the man said. “Our people have traveled far.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “My father is not here,” Phoena said, “but I can get you an audience with the council.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man’s eyes widened. “Your father?” he asked in surprise. Bowing on one knee he apologized, “I am sorry princess. I did not realize who you were.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is alright,” Phoena said sympathetically while stepping to the man’s side to lift him up from the ground. “Are you the representative of your village?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am, Princess.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Come with me. I will take you to the council.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa walked up beside Phoena. “I am so sorry,” she said to the man, brows furrowed in worry. She turned to Phoena. “I will stay and help the refugees in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Thank you.” She turned to Eamon. “Can you go ahead and let Otis know to gather the council?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon shook his head. “I cannot. I must stay by your side.” With all that was happening, he felt something was wrong and did not want to take the chance and leave when possibly he would be needed. He had made a promise to the king, after all. “But I will lend my horse to send someone in my stead.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked to him with grateful eyes and gave a nod. “Thank you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes. “You will need your horse, Eamon. Unless all of you are planning on walking there, and this man has walked enough.” She turned to the man. “You may use my horse. When you all arrive, it will take a few minutes to gather the council, but they will meet with you.” Turning to Phoena she added, “When my village arrived, we needed to send a messenger because we had not yet received permission to meet with the king. But this time, they have permission immediately from you, the princess, so there is no sense in sending someone to rush to the castle before you arrive. If you leave now, you can make it there as soon as any messenger you send.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded with a thoughtful expression. “Makes sense.” Turning to the man she said, “But do you need anything first? Water? Food?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa handed the man her canteen. “He can take mine. There are apple trees on the way. If he is anything like me, he will want to meet with the council as soon as possible. When I came, I didn’t even want to rest until I knew my people were cared for.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man nodded. “That is correct. The welfare of my people comes first.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a gentle smile. “Alright then, let us go.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “What did the council decide?” Vanessa asked Phoena later that night after she had returned to the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              “They will help the new refugees as best they can,” Phoena conveyed. “However, because so many families have taken in families from Solaris, they don’t know how many people will be able to house them. They will have to set up tents outside the city gates.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That doesn’t seem right,” Vanessa crossed her arms. “They came to seek refuge within the gates, to feel safe from any threat that might come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The people of the city are trying their best to fit as many families within the walls as they can, but it is getting crowded. Many people have given up their space in the market to let families set up tents there.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What will happen if more villages are attacked and more people come for refuge?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena lowered her eyes. “I honestly am not sure.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Will the council at least send knights to go investigate the village? Like what your father did for Solaris.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Not yet. The council feels that if there is a threat headed here, we will need all the knights. When the knights return from Solaris, they will then send some to scout out the other village.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa shook her head. “I suppose that makes tactical sense, but I feel like making the others wait is wrong. I know what it is like to lose a home. They will want to return as soon as they can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena placed a hand on Vanessa’s shoulder. “I understand this is difficult for you. I will not say I know what you are feeling, but I can only imagine that it hurts. But I trust the council. My father picked each member, and I trust his judgment. They want to do what is best for everyone, but we can only do so much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa shrugged Phoena’s hand off. “I understand,” was all she said as she left the room.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Vanessa left the room, Phoena gave a heavy sigh, uncertain of what to do. She felt guilty for not being able to provide refuge for the people sooner, but it would take time. She was afraid Vanessa was not truly understanding of what they were able to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stood near her. He felt and understood the weight of her sigh. She had never had to deal with such tragedies, and now she was doing it without her father. He could imagine the insecurities she was experiencing at that moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You did a great job today,” he encouraged her. She looked back at him and tried to smile. “You shouldn’t have to deal with this,” he continued, “but you handled yourself very well.”            </p>
            <p>
              “My people shouldn’t have to deal with this,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Eamon added, “you’re not alone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Eamon,” Phoena smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You’re welcome, Phoena.”
