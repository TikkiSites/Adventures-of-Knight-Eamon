              General Renato thumped his foot impatiently as he sat. The men were watering their horses before they continued their search for Princess Phoena. It was well into the night, and General Renato was anxious to find her and Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “If you tense up, sir, it will be a painful ride for you,” a knight said to the troubled general. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel gave a half smile. “You are right, but I cannot help feeling anxious. We must hurry on our way.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The knight furrowed his brow. “I understand the urgency to find the princess, but do you really think she could be in danger?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel looked down and shook his head. “I don’t know. Anything can happen out in the woods. At this time of uncertainty, with supposed dragon raids on innocent people, who can say?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The knight nodded in understanding. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Here,” he said holding out a canteen. “You must rehydrate as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you.” Gabriel took the canteen and sipped the water inside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Reginald walked up to them. “The horses are watered and the men are ready to continue,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Very good,” the general said as he stood. “I assume they would have set up camp and not be riding all night like we are. Hopefully we will find Princes Phoena tonight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The knights mounted their horses and rode deeper into the woods, the lantern bearers leading the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some time, General Renato looked into the sky and noticed the constellations through the openings of the trees. They did not seem to be in the right positions. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Halt!” he called. The mounted knights stopped their horses.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is wrong?” Sir Reginald asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general rode up to the knight bearing the map. “We are heading in the wrong direction.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Begging your pardon, general,” the knight said humbly, “but we are not.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The village is south and we are heading south-east,” Gabriel said with a bit of annoyance, though not with aggression. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The knight held up the map. “But the south way is full of rocky terrain. South-east will take longer, but it is the safest route. Surely that would be the way the princess would go.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That doesn’t sound correct,” the general said while holding the map to a lantern. As he looked it over, the map showed rocky slopes in the south, but that was not what he remembered. He had traveled these woods hundreds of times, and he couldn’t remember the slopes in the south. As he looked at the map, he couldn’t help feeling like something was off. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where did you get this map?” he insisted. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The palace library, where we keep all the official maps,” the knight answered. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              “I don’t know how, but this map must have been tampered with,” Gabriel said.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir!” a knight exclaimed. “Are you suggesting we have an imposter among us?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know what this means, but I know it is wrong. But before we start pointing fingers, we must first find Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              One knight looked around skeptically, eyeing each of the other knights. “But would it be safe to have the princess with us if there is a traitor among us?” he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is no proof there is a traitor,” General Renato stated. “If there is, it may not be one of us. I know each of you, and I trust each of you. We must find the princess first, then we can worry about solving this later. We will head south.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As he turned his horse to the south, the other knights hesitated, but followed. As they went deeper into the forest, Gabriel felt doubt plague his mind. Was the south way correct? He knew it was, so why did he question himself?
            </p>
            <p>
              “Are you sure about this, sir?” a knight called out, sounding unsure himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am,” he called back, though he still felt discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              As they moved deeper, Gabriel’s horse started twitching. It turned back the way they came.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Whoa,” Gabriel said. He turned the horse back, but the horse fought his lead. It kept turning back in an agitated way. All the other horses seemed to do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Even the horses seem to question this direction, sir,” a knight called. “Animals seem to have a sixth sense. Maybe we should turn back.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No!” General Renato called. “I know these woods! We are headed in the correct direction. Press on!”
            </p>
            <p>
              He nudged his horse forward. The horse fought, but he fought back, uncertainty still pressing his mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly the horse reared back. The general held on tight while trying to steady his horse. The horse continued to rear and buck violently. After a few seconds that felt like an eternity, the horse reared one final time, stronger than before, and Gabriel fell.
            </p>
            <p>
              All went black.
            </p>
