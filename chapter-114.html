The men were watering their horses before they continued their search for Princess Phoena. It was well into the night, and General Renato was anxious to find her and Eamon.

              “If you tense up, sir, it will be a painful ride for you,” a knight said to the troubled general. 

              Gabriel gave a half smile. “You are right, but I cannot help feeling anxious. We must hurry on our way.”

              The knight furrowed his brow. “I understand the urgency to find the princess, but do you really think she could be in danger?”

              Gabriel looked down and shook his head. “I don’t know. Anything can happen out in the woods. At this time of uncertainty, with supposed dragon raids on innocent people, who can say?”

              The knight nodded in understanding. 

              “Here,” he said holding out a canteen. “You must rehydrate as well.”

              “Thank you.” Gabriel took the canteen and sipped the water inside..

              Sir Reginald walked up to them. “The horses are watered and the men are ready to continue,” he said.“Very good,” the general said as he stood. “I assume they would have set up camp and not be riding all night like we are. Hopefully we will find Princes Phoena tonight.”The knights mounted their horses and rode deeper into the woods, the lantern bearers leading the way.

              After some time, General Renato looked into the sky and noticed the constellations. They did not seem to be in the right positions. 

              After some time, General Renato looked into the sky through the openings of the trees and noticed the constellations. They did not seem to be in the right positions. 

              “Halt!” he called. The mounted knights stopped their horses.

              “What is wrong?” Sir Reginald asked.

              The general rode up to the knight bearing the map. “We are heading in the wrong direction.”

              “Begging your pardon, sir,” the knight said humbly, “but we are not.”

              “The village is south and we are heading south-east,” Gabriel said with a bit annoyance, though not with aggression.
