	            Eamon stood, back against the wall in the dining hall while Princess Phoena’s breakfast was laid out for her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where is Papa?” she asked the maid that brought her breakfast. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “He will be here presently,” the maid responded. “He just had a couple things to attend to.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a small look of disappointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The king told me to tell you not to wait,” the maid said when Phoena did not touch her food. “You will want to eat it while it is warm.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t like eating without him,” Phoena said. “Would you keep my food warm with Papa’s while I wait?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The maid smiled. “Very well, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess waited patiently for her father, sitting straight and still. She only had to wait a few minutes before the king entered.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Phoena,” he said and gave her a kiss on the top of her head. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Papa,” she hugged him.
            </p>
            <p>
	           “Did you wait?” he asked when he saw the empty place setting in front of her. “You didn’t have to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “I didn’t mind,” she responded. “I’d rather eat with you. What did you have to do that breakfast had to wait?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I had some business to discuss with General Renato. I wanted him to assign some knights to go and scout Solaris. I want to know what happened there and if it is safe for the villagers to return home.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The people of Solaris will appreciate that very much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “General Renato will also be assigning knights to join me to Lóng Hún.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are going to Lóng Hún?” Phoena asked in slight surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” King Titus answered. “I want to check with them about the dragons. I have several questions for them.” He gave a distant look. “Mostly I want to check that they are alright.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What do you mean?” Phoena asked innocently.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Tutus shook his head. “Never mind that. Let us enjoy breakfast.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon watched silently as they ate, pondering on what the king had said. He knew what he meant. If the dragons of Lóng Hún had gone rogue, Lóng Hún would be the first village attacked. It was, after all, right at the base of the dragons’ mountain. The king would not want to worry his daughter about that. If the village of Lóng Hún was not raided, then that would mean that the villagers would have had some part in the raids on Solaris, and who knows what other villages. If this was an act of war against Orea, King Titus would be in great danger entering Lóng Hún. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            But why would Lóng Hún want war with Orea? This must be one of the questions King Titus had. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              As the day went on, Phoena stayed by her father’s side, wanting to spend as much time with him as possible before he left for Lóng Hún. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When the time came that the king had to leave, Phoena’s eyes were wet with tears.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the knights prepared their horses, King Titus pulled away form Phoena for only a moment to speak with Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardel,” he said,” you know I trust you with everything, don’t you?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” Eamon stated, knowing the king’s “everything” was his daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You have been patient and steadfast for all this time. I know you yearn for more. But know that you are where you need to be. There is no better position I can give you than what I have given you thus far. I trust no one else to watch over Phoena more than I trust you. I know you are loyal and dedicated. I know you will do everything you can to protect her from any harm. That is why I need you to stay. I know you long to go out and do great things, but nothing can be greater, at least for me, than staying to watch over my daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stood as straight as he could. “You can count on me, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus slapped his hand on Eamon’s shoulder and gave a warm smile. “I know I can.” He added a bit more quietly, “while I am away, it is vital that you stay extra alert. I fear that any foe of Orea will attempt something dire.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded in understanding. King Titus smiled and returned to his horse.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I understand why you need to go,” Phoena said, trying not to cry. “I only wish I could go with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king placed a hand on Phoena’s cheek. “I need you to stay here. All will be well. I need to get some answers, then I will be back.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “But it is so far away,” Phoena said.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus smiled. “I will be back before you know it.” he gave Phoena a kiss and mounted his horse. Then he rode off with a dozen knights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena watched until she could no longer see her father. She gave a deep sigh. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “All will be well, Princess,” Eamon stated. 
            </p>
            <p>
              She gave a small smile. As she turned to him, she said, “I know you wanted to join him as well. This could have been your chance to go on an adventure, a real quest. But you didn’t even ask.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt a slight blush of embarrassment. Was he that obvious? But with a straight face he said, “I do what the king commands me. He wishes me to stay and be your guardian. That is what I will do.” He added a bow to show his respect and the sincerity of his statement.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">

            </p>
            <p>
              The day deepened into early evening as the princess went to the guest hallways to check up on several of the refugees. Many stated they did not know what to do with themselves. They had no responsibilities that they were used to doing in their village. Some found time to visit with the castle staff, talking with maids as they tidied the rooms and dusted the halls. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Phoena and Eamon walked down the hall, they came across Vanessa. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh, Your Highness,” she said. “I am so happy to see you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is good to see you as well,” Phoena said with a happy smile.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I was hoping to talk with you about something of great importance.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena said unsure. “My father has left, so you will need to take up any concerns you have with his advisor, Otis.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is no concern,” Vanessa stated, correcting her urgent tone. “I was just hoping to speak with you about a position as your handmaid.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Oh,” Phoena said again. “ I would not ask that of you. I have handmaids and you are a guest.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I want to,” she said in sincerity. “You have shown my people great love and service. I would like to repay you in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled, “You do not need to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “But I want to,” Vanessa stated again. “I have talked with several servants throughout the castle, and they have told me of the respect you and your father show to all of them. They love serving you and I want to show that same gratitude.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you. But I have no say in that decision. Well, not the ultimate say. Only my father can staff the servants of the castle. Or his advisor who acts for him while he is away.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Then I would like to speak with Otis.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t know,” Phoena said. “I am honored that you wish to do such a thing for me, but I cannot ask you to.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You did not ask. I am asking.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena was silent a moment, inspecting Vanessa’s face. “I suppose so. I can take you to Otis now.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “This will be fun!” Phoena stated as she helped Vanessa settle in her new handmaiden’s quarters. “Don’t get me wrong, I love all my handmaids. They are like family to me. But it will be fun having someone my age. It will be like having a sister!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa laughed. “I’m glad you are happy with this. I am a bit excited, too. I never had any siblings to care for. It will be a new adventure for me.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “So,” Phoena said interested?, “tell me about yourself. You mentioned you don’t have siblings. What about your parents? Did I meet them yesterday?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Vanessa hesitated with a shrug, “not exactly. My parents died when I was just a child. I kind of just wandered from family to family, staying in no particular place. You could say I was a nomad for a long time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow in sympathy. “I am so sorry. You don’t have to talk about it if it is a sensitive subject for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Thank you, but it is all right. I've grown used to it. Eventually I found my way to Solaris and the people accepted me as one of their own, and Loxias and his wife took me in. I suppose they are the closest thing I ever had to parents.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled gently. “That is so nice. How long have you been with them?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “For about five years. They found me when I was ten. They treated me as if I was their own daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is wonderful. I have seen what caring people do when they take a child into their home and hearts.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You speak of Sir Ardel?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprised, Phoena asked, “How did you know?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “He mentioned it last night. I asked about his name—because it is not an Orean name—and he told me his story.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena blinked in shock. “I’m surprised he did that. He is not one for much conversation, and he never talks about his past.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a guilty shrug. “Well, he didn’t tell me much of his story. He just mentioned he was taken in by a knight in answer to a question I had. He didn’t say much else.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded. “That makes more sense. He keeps to himself a lot.” Her expression changed to a distant, concerned look. “Which concerns me. He is very stoic, but I’ve wondered how he has been handling these last two days, with all the events that have happened.”
            </p>
            <p>
              With an intrigued look, Vanessa asked, “Why do you say that?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena shifted uncomfortably. “If he did not tell you, I should not.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa narrowed her eyes in thought. “Does it have anything to do with the elven attack on Tearmann?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave her another surprised look. “Why would you assume that?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa gave a nonchalant shrug. “I am not ignorant to the events in other kingdoms. It makes sense and the timing is right. First hint: his name. Ardel is a Miotasian name, and Tearmann was one of the few human villages in the kingdom. The attack happened thirteen years ago, so he would have been a young boy then. If his family did not survive the attack, it would make sense why he was taken in by another family. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The attack on Tearmann was led by Sheridan,” Vanessa continued, “the last Miotasian dragon. I can understand why you are concerned for Sir Ardel. A dragon attack must be bringing back terrible memories for him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are good,” Phoena said amazed by Vanessa’s deduction. “How do you know all this?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Being a nomad for most of my life, I hear stories. I also like to learn about the histories of other nations.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “So you have traveled a lot. Do you remember your original home at all?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa scrunched her brow in thought. “Not much. I remember it being very green and by a beautiful lake. That is all.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I can’t imagine not remembering my home,” Phoena said with a deep sigh. “I wonder how much Eamon remembers of his home. I fear all that he does remember is the attack.” She then looked to Vanessa with pleading eyes, “Please do not tell him I mentioned anything. I don’t want him to feel like I am invading his privacy. I also don’t want to open wounds by bringing up his past.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “Don’t worry. You can trust me, Princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Please, it’s Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa nodded. “You can trust me, Phoena.”
