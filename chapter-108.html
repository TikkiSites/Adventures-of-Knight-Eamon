            <p>
	            Eamon stood, back against the wall in the dining hall while Princess Phoena’s breakfast was laid out for her.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where is Papa?” she asked the maid that brought her breakfast. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “He will be here presently,” the maid responded. “He just had a couple things to attend to.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a small look of disappointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The king told me to tell you not to wait,” the maid said when Phoena did not touch her food. “You will want to eat it while it is warm.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t like eating without him,” Phoena said. “Would you keep my food warm with Papa’s while I wait?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The maid smiled. “Very well, princess.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess waited patiently for her father, sitting straight and still. She only had to wait a few minutes before the king entered.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Phoena,” he said and gave her a kiss on the top of her head. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good morrow, Papa,” she hugged him.
            </p>
            <p>
	           “Did you wait?” he asked when he saw the empty place setting in front of her. “You didn’t have to do that.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “I didn’t mind,” she responded. “I’d rather eat with you. What did you have to do that breakfast had to wait?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I had some business to discuss with General Renato. I wanted him to assign some knights to go and scout Solaris. I want to know what happened there and if it is safe for the villagers to return home.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The people of Solaris will appreciate that very much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “General Renato will also be assigning knights to join me to Lóng Hún.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You are going to Lóng Hún?” Phoena asked in slight surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” King Titus answered. “I want to check with them about the dragons. I have several questions for them.” He gave a distant look. “Mostly I want to check that they are alright.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What do you mean?” Phoena asked innocently.
            </p>
            <p>
              King Tutus shook his head. “Never mind that. Let us enjoy breakfast.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon watched silently as they ate, pondering on what the king had said. He knew what he meant. If the dragons of Lóng Hún had gone rogue, Lóng Hún would be the first village attacked. It was, after all, right at the base of the dragons’ mountain. The king would not want to worry his daughter about that. If the village of Lóng Hún was not raided, then that would mean that the villagers would have had some part in the raids on Solaris, and who knows what other villages. If this was an act of war against Orea, King Titus would be in great danger entering Lóng Hún. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            But why would Lóng Hún want war with Orea? This must be one of the questions King Titus had. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              As the day went on, Phoena stayed by her father’s side, wanting to spend as much time with him as possible before he left for Lóng Hún. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When the time came that the king had to leave, Phoena’s eyes were wet with tears.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the knights prepared their horses, King Titus pulled away form Phoena for only a moment to speak with Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardel,” he said,” you know I trust you with everything, don’t you?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” Eamon stated, knowing the king’s “everything” was his daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You have been patient and steadfast for all this time. I know you yearn for more. But know that you are where you need to be. There is no better position I can give you than what I have given you thus far. I trust no one else to watch over Phoena more than I trust you. I know you are loyal and dedicated. I know you will do everything you can to protect her from any harm. That is why I need you to stay. I know you long to go out and do great things, but nothing can be greater, at least for me, than staying to watch over my daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stood as straight as he could. “You can count on me, Sire.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            King Titus slapped his hand on Eamon’s shoulder and gave a warm smile. “I know I can.” He added a bit more quietly, “while I am away, it is vital that you stay extra alert. I fear that any foe of Orea will attempt something dire.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            After King Titus entered the room, the handmaid closed the door and went back to the washroom to finish some final duties. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus walked through the small entryway and turned to the bedchamber where Phoena sat on the chest at the end of her bed. A book rested in her lap, but she was not reading. She stared off with a tired expression. When he walked in, she woke up enough to greet him. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Papa!” she said, getting up from the chest and giving him a hug.
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Quite an eventful day, wasn’t it?” Titus said, giving his daughter a kiss on the top of her head. “Not the birthday celebration we had planned for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a tired shrug. “Yes, well, no one could have expected it. But it was still a good birthday. I’m glad to have spent it helping our people.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus smiled softly at his daughter. “I am touched with the sacrifice you gave today. The people are lucky to have such a compassionate princess, and I am blessed to have such a loving daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            Phoena smiled up at him. “I learn from the best.” She gave him another big hug.
            </p>
            <p>
	            After holding the embrace for a moment, Titus said, “I will not keep you any longer from the rest you deserve. Have a wonderful night, my little angel. Happy birthday.”
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Thank you, Papa. You as well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              After tucking her into bed, he gave her one last kiss and walked to the terrace door. As he passed through, the guards on the other side only turned their heads for a moment to see who was exiting the room, then they continued their normal stance at attention. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Stay extra alert tonight,” the king repeated the instructions to these guards. “Good night,” he said as he walked down the terrace. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            “Good night, Sire,” the guards said in unison. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus breathed in the night air deeply as he strolled the small walkway of the terrace, deep in thought. Something about the events of the day seemed off to him. He could not quite figure out what it was. 
            </p>
            <p>
             	Almost absentmindedly, he reached into his vest pocket and pulled out a small necklace charm of a white lily. He fingered it gently as he studied the shapes of the petals and thought deeply about his departed wife. The events of the day had brought back painful memories. He furrowed his brow in pain and clasped the charm tightly in is hand as the memory of her final day played through his mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Titus stopped walking for a moment and leaned on the railing of the terrace, looking out to the town below. But what he saw was not what was there. What he saw were horrifying memories. The memory of the blinding flash still burned his eyes. When the flash vanished, his wife was gone. He raised his clenched fist to his brow as tears rolled down his cheeks. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He opened his fist and looked again at the charm. He gave a small smile as he tried to console his thoughts with happy memories. He still had his daughter. She was the light and joy in his life. He would do anything to protect her from harm. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He placed the charm back in his pocket. 
            </p>
            <p>
	            He breathed deeply as he looked out once again to the town below. In deep thought he looked to the distant mountains. He furrowed his brown in concern as he thought about the information he had received that day. The thought of a dragon raid was absurd. Although, it was not impossible. If the Mother Dragon had awakened, why was he not informed? Why would the dragons of Lóng Hún go against their peaceful nature? 
            </p>
            <p>
	            Hundreds of questions filled the king’s mind, and he needed to find the answers.
