            <p>
              Darkness surrounded Eamon as he wept. There was only a little light that leaked through the hole from the knot he had picked out of the wood. The small boy didn’t understand what was happening. He only wanted to be with his Papa. The darkness around him had made him feel safe for a short time, but now he was worried. What if no one found him? He didn’t know what to do. He sobbed in a greater volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What was that?” he heard a muffled voice outside his hiding spot. He heard footsteps approaching. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am sorry,” Phoena said. “I just miss Papa.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He suddenly held his breath. What if it was one of the bad people? He didn’t want one of them to find him.
            </p>
            <p>
              He heard splintering sounds as bark was pulled away. The light from the small hole flicked as an arm on the other side passed it several times as the person pulled at the bark. Eamon backed away as far as he could in the small space until he clung to the other side. Soon the blade of a small dagger gently penetrated the wood and stuck through only a slight bit. The blade wiggled carefully as the bearer slowly pried the wood apart.
            </p>
            <p>
              With more splintering sounds the wood slowly gave way and a pair of hands replaced the dagger in prying the wood apart. Shortly after, a large chunk of the tree was gone, and gazing in through the hole was a young man kneeling down. He was clad in armor from shoulder to toe. His head had no helmet. His dark hair was damp with sweat. Streaks of dried sweat and mud ran down his clean shaven face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              His eyes were wide with surprise as he gazed at this little boy inside the tree.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unsure of who this man was, Eamon tried backing away, but could not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man crouched a little lower and reached out to Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do not be afraid, little one,” he said in a gentle voice. “I am here to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Hesitantly, Eamon reached for his hand and the man pulled him out of the tree and knelt beside him. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is your name, little one?” He asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ea…Eamon,” the boy hesitated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man smiled gently. He looked back to the tree for a moment. “It looks like you were well protected,” he said with a soft, but almost mournful, smile. He looked back to Eamon. “Let us find your family, Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He picked up the little boy and walked away from the tree toward a group of men in the nearby field. They all wore armor, some the same heavy armor the man wore, others in long suits of chain-mail—like what Eamon’s father wore. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man set Eamon down when they reached the group of shoulders. He addressed a man in chainmail that Eamon recognized as someone from the village that worked with his Papa. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good sir, do you know this boy and his family?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man looked at Eamon and his eyes widened for just a moment, then he furrowed his brow in sorrow. “Eamon,” he said, “son of Aurick Ardal.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ardal?” the dark haired man said in a sympathetic tone. He looked down at Eamon with a furrowed brow. Looking back at the man, he added, “Is there someone who can take him to his mother?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man furrowed his brow deeper and shook his head. “His mother died in childbirth.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man looked back down at Eamon. “Is there anyone in your village who will take him in?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man answered without hesitation, “I’m sure there would be,” he paused a moment, “under normal circumstances. But with everything that has happened, it would be difficult to ask anyone to take him in. It will be difficult for people to care for their own families.” 
            </p>
            <p> 
              “We must find a home for him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “With all due respect, Sire, all my people need to find new homes. Orea is still healthy. Could you take him back and find someone there to take him in?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “He has a point,” another man added. He was fully clad in heavy armor, including his helmet. Eamon backed away a bit and hid behind the dark haired man’s leg. The man was large, and his helmeted face was intimidating. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man knelt down beside Eamon. “It’s alright,” he said. “He is a friend.” He stood back up and addressed the man, “I assume your patrol was successful?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” the armored man said as he raised the visor of his helmet. “We patrolled all around Tearman. All the elves are gone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man said nothing but nodded with a somber expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              The armored man looked down at Eamon. He unlatched his helmet and removed it. Kneeling down, he set his helmet on the ground. He had a strong face that had a mustache and goatee. His dark eyes were soft. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hello there, young one,” he said. “Do we need to find you a new home?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon whimpered, “I want Papa.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              He furrowed his brow in sympathy. “Your papa cannot come back, Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No!” Eamon cried. “I want Papa.”
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
              The man’s eyes widened. “Your father?” he asked in surprise. Bowing on one knee he apologized, “I am sorry princess. I did not realize who you were.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is alright,” Phoena said sympathetically while stepping to the man’s side to lift him up from the ground. “Are you the representative of your village?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am, Princess.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Come with me. I will take you to the council.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa walked up beside Phoena. “I am so sorry,” she said to the man, brows furrowed in worry. She turned to Phoena. “I will stay and help the refugees in whatever way I can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled. “Thank you.” She turned to Eamon. “Can you go ahead and let Otis know to gather the council?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon shook his head. “I cannot. I must stay by your side.” With all that was happening, he felt something was wrong and did not want to take the chance and leave when possibly he would be needed. He had made a promise to the king, after all. “But I will lend my horse to send someone in my stead.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked to him with grateful eyes and gave a nod. “Thank you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes. “You will need your horse, Eamon. Unless all of you are planning on walking there, and this man has walked enough.” She turned to the man. “You may use my horse. When you all arrive, it will take a few minutes to gather the council, but they will meet with you.” Turning to Phoena she added, “When my village arrived, we needed to send a messenger because we had not yet received permission to meet with the king. But this time, they have permission immediately from you, the princess, so there is no sense in sending someone to rush to the castle before you arrive. If you leave now, you can make it there as soon as any messenger you send.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena nodded with a thoughtful expression. “Makes sense.” Turning to the man she said, “But do you need anything first? Water? Food?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa handed the man her canteen. “He can take mine. There are apple trees on the way. If he is anything like me, he will want to meet with the council as soon as possible. When I came, I didn’t even want to rest until I knew my people were cared for.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man nodded. “That is correct. The welfare of my people comes first.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a gentle smile. “Alright then, let us go.”
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “What did the council decide?” Vanessa asked Phoena later that night after she had returned to the castle.
            </p>
            <p>
              “They will help the new refugees as best they can,” Phoena conveyed. “However, because so many families have taken in families from Solaris, they don’t know how many people will be able to house them. They will have to set up tents outside the city gates.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That doesn’t seem right,” Vanessa crossed her arms. “They came to seek refuge within the gates, to feel safe from any threat that might come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The people of the city are trying their best to fit as many families within the walls as they can, but it is getting crowded. Many people have given up their space in the market to let families set up tents there.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What will happen if more villages are attacked and more people come for refuge?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena lowered her eyes. “I honestly am not sure.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Will the council at least send knights to go investigate the village? Like what your father did for Solaris.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Not yet. The council feels that if there is a threat headed here, we will need all the knights. When the knights return from Solaris, they will then send some to scout out the other village.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa shook her head. “I suppose that makes tactical sense, but I feel like making the others wait is wrong. I know what it is like to lose a home. They will want to return as soon as they can.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena placed a hand on Vanessa’s shoulder. “I understand this is difficult for you. I will not say I know what you are feeling, but I can only imagine that it hurts. But I trust the council. My father picked each member, and I trust his judgment. They want to do what is best for everyone, but we can only do so much.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa shrugged Phoena’s hand off. “I understand,” was all she said as she left the room.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Vanessa left the room, Phoena gave a heavy sigh, uncertain of what to do. She felt guilty for not being able to provide refuge for the people sooner, but it would take time. She was afraid Vanessa was not truly understanding of what they were able to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon stood near her. He felt and understood the weight of her sigh. She had never had to deal with such tragedies, and now she was doing it without her father. He could imagine the insecurities she was experiencing at that moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You did a great job today,” he encouraged her. She looked back at him and tried to smile. “You shouldn’t have to deal with this,” he continued, “but you handled yourself very well.”            </p>
            <p>
              “My people shouldn’t have to deal with this,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well,” Eamon added, “you’re not alone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, Eamon,” Phoena smiled.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You’re welcome, Phoena.”
            </p>
