          <div class="chapter-novel-paragraph">
            <p>
              Darkness surrounded Eamon as he wept. There was only a little light that leaked through the hole from the knot he had picked out of the wood. The small boy didn’t understand what was happening. He only wanted to be with his Papa. The darkness around him had made him feel safe for a short time, but now he was worried. What if no one found him? He didn’t know what to do. He sobbed in a greater volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              “What was that?” he heard a muffled voice outside his hiding spot. He heard footsteps approaching. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He suddenly held his breath. What if it was one of the bad people? He didn’t want one of them to find him.
            </p>
            <p>
              He heard splintering sounds as bark was pulled away. The light from the small hole flickered as an arm on the other side passed it several times as the person pulled at the bark. Eamon backed away as far as he could in the small space until he clung to the other side. Soon the blade of a small dagger gently penetrated the wood and stuck through only a slight bit. The blade wiggled carefully as the bearer slowly pried the wood apart.
            </p>
            <p>
              With more splintering sounds the wood slowly gave way and a pair of hands replaced the dagger in prying the wood apart. Shortly after, a large chunk of the tree was gone, and gazing in through the hole was a young man kneeling down. He was clad in armor from shoulder to toe. His head had no helmet. His dark hair was damp with sweat. Streaks of dried sweat and mud ran down his clean shaven face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              His eyes were wide with surprise as he gazed at this little boy inside the tree.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unsure of who this man was, Eamon tried backing away, but could not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man crouched a little lower and reached out to Eamon.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do not be afraid, little one,” he said in a gentle voice. “I am here to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Hesitantly, Eamon reached for his hand and the man pulled him out of the tree and knelt beside him. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “What is your name, little one?” He asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ea…Eamon,” the boy hesitated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The man smiled gently. He looked back to the tree for a moment. “It looks like you were well protected,” he said with a soft, but almost mournful, smile. He looked back to Eamon. “Let us find your family, Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He picked up the little boy and walked away from the tree toward a group of men in the nearby field. They all wore armor, some wore the same heavy armor the man wore, while others wore long suits of chain-mail—like what Eamon’s father wore. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man set Eamon down when they reached the group of soldiers. He addressed a man in chainmail that Eamon recognized as someone from the village that worked with his Papa. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Good sir, do you know this boy and his family?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man looked at Eamon and his eyes widened for just a moment, then he furrowed his brow in sorrow. “Eamon,” he said, “son of Aurick Ardal.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ardal?” the dark haired man said in a sympathetic tone. He looked down at Eamon with a furrowed brow. Looking back at the man, he added, “Is there someone who can take him to his mother?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man furrowed his brow deeper and shook his head. “His mother died in childbirth.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man looked back down at Eamon. “Is there anyone in your village who will take him in?” 
            </p>
            <p>
              The man answered without hesitation, “I’m sure there would be,” he paused a moment, “under normal circumstances. But with everything that has happened, it would be difficult to ask anyone to take him in. It will be difficult for people to care for their own families.” 
            </p>
            <p> 
              “We must find a home for him.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “With all due respect, Sire, all my people need to find new homes. Orea is still healthy. Could you take him back and find someone there to take him in?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “He has a point,” another man added. He was fully clad in heavy armor, including his helmet. Eamon backed away a bit and hid behind the dark haired man’s leg. The man was large, and his helmeted face was intimidating. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man knelt down beside Eamon. “It’s alright,” he said. “He is a friend.” He stood back up and addressed the man, “I assume your patrol was successful?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Sire,” the armored man said as he raised the visor of his helmet. “We patrolled all around Tearman. All the elves are gone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man said nothing but nodded with a somber expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              The armored man looked down at Eamon. He unlatched his helmet and removed it. Kneeling down, he set his helmet on the ground. He had a strong face that had a mustache and goatee. His dark eyes were soft. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hello there, young one,” he said. “Do we need to find you a new home?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon whimpered, “I want Papa.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              He furrowed his brow in sympathy. “Your papa cannot come back, Eamon.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “No!” Eamon cried. “I want Papa.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The man furrowed his brow deeper. He stood up and spoke with the dark haired man, “I can take him in.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Gabriel, are you sure? A child is a big responsibility, and you already have a lot of responsibilities. What would Clarisa say?”
            </p>
            <p>
              He smiled. “I am certain. Clarisa and I have been wanting a child for some time. She would be happy to care for this boy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The dark haired man smiled gently. “I know she would. I cannot think of a better home for this boy.”  
            </p>
            <p>
              The man smiled and knelt again before Eamon. “Would you like to come with me, Eamon? I will take good care of you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He took off his gauntlets and reached out his hand and waited for the boy to take it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon looked at the hand then up to the man’s face. He caught his eyes. The man’s eyes looked sincere and kind. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While still looking at his face, Eamon reached out his hand and placed it in the man’s. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">
              <strong>* * *</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Eamon,” a distant voice called. “Time to wake up, hijo.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon blinked his eyes several times as he propped himself up. General Renato stood beside him, a friendly smile on his face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You must have been having a good dream. It took a while to wake you.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon smiled. “It was a good dream.” Granted, dreaming of the memory of losing his father was sad, but the rest of his memory of when he became a part of the Renato family was pleasant. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Buenos días, Papá,” he added.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general smiled wider. “Good morning, son.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              As Eamon ate breakfast and observed the man and woman that took him in so long ago, he couldn't help but smile. They were good people, and he was happy to be a part of their family. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m glad I am able to walk with you today, hijo,” General Renato said as they made their way to the castle. Oftentimes he had to arrive at the castle much earlier than Eamon would. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am glad too,” Eamon said. “Tell me about when you and Mamá came to Orea,” he added after a moment. 
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato smiled. “I must have told you a thousand times.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I know. I just think it is timeless.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “All, right then.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Clarisa and I grew up together. We knew when we were teenagers that we would marry each other….”
            </p>
            <p>
              “¡Ay, Papá!” Eamon exclaimed. “Leave out the mushy stuff.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel laughed.  
            </p>
            <p>
              “After we were married,” he continued, “we wanted to travel the world. We traveled all over, one adventure after another. Until we came to Orea and met Alexander Titus. He was a young prince at the time and very adventurous himself. Although he was much younger than Clarisa and I, we knew we had found a kindred spirit and we became good friends quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Clarisa and I stayed in Orea for quite some time, and we were planning on leaving on our next adventure. We loved Orea and all the people, but we wanted to travel more….”
            </p>
            <p>
              “And then King Titus invited you to become a knight,” Eamon interrupted. “But there is more to the story. More to the reason why you stayed, isn’t there? Not just because you were friends and he made you a knight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel nodded with a soft smile. “Yes, there is. Alexander’s father died unexpectedly and Alexander was crowned king at a young age. The sorrow of losing his father along with the weight of an entire kingdom now resting on his shoulders was a great burden for him. His invitation to become a knight was more than an honor. It was a plea for us to stay. He needed friends that would help him bear the weight. Although we could not fully place ourselves in a yoke—shall we say?—with the new king, we were there to offer advice and opinions where we could.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon smiled in admiration at his adopted father. “You gave up further adventures to support a friend.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel laughed again. “In a way, I suppose. But not entirely. We still traveled a lot and had many adventures. It just wasn’t in the way we had originally planned.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              He ruffled Eamon’s hair. “Like you. If we hadn’t stayed, we wouldn’t have been blessed to raise a son like you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon laughed lightly at the playful gesture and pushed away playfully. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The thing is,” Gabriel continued, “you don’t have to travel to distant lands to have adventures.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon walked in thoughtful silence for a moment before Gabriel stopped and faced Eamon directly. He placed a hand on Eamon’s shoulder and looked into his eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I know that the last couple years have not been what you had planned or expected. I know you expected more out of being a knight. I know you long to explore and go on adventures. I see a lot of me in you. Just know that you are where you need to be. No one can say what will happen next.” He added with a sly smile. “You never know. Adventure may be just around the corner.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He let go of Eamon and continued walking. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon had much to ponder. He knew there was something more to the reason why Gabriel had stayed. He figured it was deep loyalty to his friend. That is why he had asked to hear the story again. He felt he needed to hear Gabriel’s story as an example to him. He had been thinking deeply about his role as guardian to the princess since the first village of refugees arrived. His role was about much more than responsibility. It was about loyalty. He had made a vow of loyalty to the king, but it was even deeper than that. It was about loyalty to a friend. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He looked up at his father as they continued walking. Gabriel was the most loyal man he had ever met. He showed loyalty to his friend and king, loyalty to a complete stranger he would one day call <em>son</em>, and loyalty to his people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon hoped he could show that same loyalty. If he wanted to do that, he would have to show complete loyalty and devotion to his current duties: to King Titus and especially to Princess Phoena.
