          </div>
          <div class="chapter-novel-paragraph">
            <p>
              Phoena squirmed a bit on her horse’s saddle. She loved riding, but had never ridden so much at one time. She was beginning to get achy and uncomfortable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon must have noticed. “Let’s rest here,” he said, bringing his horse to a halt. He dismounted and helped Phoena dismount. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Phoena said for more reasons than just his help. She hoped she didn’t sound desperate, but she was relieved to stand on her own legs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is a creek, just over there,” Eamon pointed beyond some trees. “We’ll cool down our horses then set up camp.”
            </p>
            <p>
              They walked their horses to the creek and they began to drink. Upstream, Eamon filled their canteens. Phoena knelt next to the stream and cupped some water in her hands then splashed it on her face. It felt so nice to cool herself off. She did it a couple more times and ran her fingers through her hair, spreading the water down her scalp. Vanessa, likewise washed her face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After the horses drank, they untacked the horses’ saddles and brushed them down. Phoena always enjoyed brushing her horse down. It was somehow relaxing to her. She always did it after riding, refusing to let a stable hand do it. Because Eamon knew this about her, he did not bother offering to do it for her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked to Eamon as he brushed his horse. He scanned the area, as if making sure no one was hiding in the bushes. Phoena chuckled softly to herself. She knew it was his job to protect her, but sometimes she felt he was a bit too paranoid. Or was it paranoia? She straightened her face as a thought came to her. Maybe he wasn’t paranoid, but more anxious—perhaps wanting something exciting to happen to break up the dull day. She knew she did not live an exciting life and that Eamon longed for adventure. She shook her head out of these thoughts. If he were looking for excitement, why would he do so now? He was finally on an adventure. True, all they had done all day was ride for hours, nothing exciting there. But he was finally breaking free of the castle boundaries. Why would he glance around as if hoping something would happen. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Vanessa finished brushing her mare, she rubbed her hands together and exclaimed, “Well, I shall go find some firewood for us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded in acknowledgment, but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Shall I come as well?” Phoena asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “No,” Eamon said hastily. “I still need to set up camp, and you cannot leave my sight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena rolled her eyes playfully. “Yes, Mamma,” she teased. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But Eamon did not look amused at her joke. Even his usual straight face seemed harder than usual. He looked as if he wanted to say, “this isn’t a joke” but he did not speak. He did not need to. His glare said it all. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Come on, Eamon,” Vanessa said. He glared at her as if annoyed she had not addressed him by his knightly title. “She will not be alone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is very reassuring,” he responded in unamused sarcasm. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m not some helpless handmaid,” Vanessa defended. “If anything were to happen, it is not like I could not handle it myself. I’m a survivor of a dragon raid. It is not like I fled as fast as I could. I also helped others. I’m not completely defenseless.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena felt a bit embarrassed that they were talking as if <em>she</em> was completely defenseless. Sure, she never trained as a knight, and she didn’t spend her life wandering alone like Vanessa had. But she was sure she wasn’t completely helpless.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon just stared at Vanessa. “No,” he said again as if his glare was not answer enough. “I am her guardian. I will not relinquish my responsibility to someone else.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes again. “Look, what if we stayed within your sight? If anything happens, we will call out and you will see. It isn’t like we will go deep. This is a forest. There is wood everywhere.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Please?” Phoena tried. “I want to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon sighed. “Alright.” He gave another glare to Vanessa. “But within my sight.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              Vanessa gave a dramatic salute and said, “Yes sir.” She tried a playful smile, but it did not change Eamon’s expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon watched carefully as they walked a small distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t think Sir Ardal likes me,” Vanessa whispered when they were a good distance away. They were within his sight, but might not have been within his hearing if they whispered. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena gave a look of surprise. “Why do you think that?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “You saw how he reacted to my ideas today. I don’t think he trusts me. And he is always scowling at me.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Oh,” Phoena gave a dismissive wave. “He always has that look of skepticism. Even when his mother is around. When he is on duty, he never shows any emotion.” She paused a moment before adding, “Even when he is off duty, I have hardly seen any emotion from him. So don’t think he doesn’t like you for that.” She gave a small chuckle and added, “Since you came, I think he has shown more emotion than usual.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Like when he yelled at me about leaving to scout the town?” Vanessa asked with a teasing glare. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Well, yes. But not just that. He almost looks happier since you came.” She cupped a hand over her mouth just in case she wasn’t talking soft enough and added, “I have even seen him almost smile a few times.” She smiled playfully. “All since you came. So don’t think he doesn’t like you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hmm,” Vanessa gave a soft smile as she contemplated what was said. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena smiled softly, but inside she felt a pinch. She wasn’t sure what it was, but she thought it strange that Eamon did seem to be enjoying his post more since Vanessa became her handmaid. Could he bare his boring position more easily if Vanessa was there? Was it not so boring when she was present? She chuckled to herself about the fact that Eamon might, in fact, <em>like</em> Vanessa, despite his disagreements with her. But even as she chuckled, she felt that strange pinch inside once again. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Still,” Vanessa said after a moment. “He glares at me all the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena chuckled. “Just ignore that. He glares at everyone and everything when he is in his ‘protective’ state.” She gave a sigh and added, “Sometimes I feel he is too obsessed over it.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa smiled. “He is dedicated, and that is a good thing. He is only doing what his king has asked him to.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ugh!” Phoena moaned, tilting her head back. “That is another thing. I don’t understand Papa’s paranoia. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate that he wants to protect me, and I am glad to have Sir Eamon around, but I just think Papa goes a little overboard as well.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa chuckled. “He is a father. That is what they do.” Then her gaze went distant, and her expression blanked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena furrowed her brow. “Are you alright?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa shook her head, as if dismissing a memory, then smiled. “I’m fine. Thank you.” Then she quickly changed the subject, “I think we have enough twigs. Now we need a few good logs.” She turned to look for some behind her. With Vanessa’s back turned, Phoena could tell she did not want to talk any more about the topic, so she didn’t inquire more.
