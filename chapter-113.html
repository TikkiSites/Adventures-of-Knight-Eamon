          </div>
          <div class="chapter-novel-paragraph">
            <p>
              Phoena squirmed a bit on her horse’s saddle. She loved riding, but had never ridden so much at one time. She was beginning to get achy and uncomfortable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon must have noticed. “Let’s rest here,” he said, bringing his horse to a halt. He dismounted and helped Phoena dismount. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you,” Phoena said for more reasons than just his help. She hoped she didn’t sound desperate, but she was relieved to stand on her own legs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “There is a creek, just over there,” Eamon pointed beyond some trees. “We’ll cool down our horses then set up camp.”
            </p>
            <p>
              They walked their horses to the creek and they began to drink. Upstream, Eamon filled their canteens. Phoena knelt to the stream and cupped some water in her hands then splashed it on her face. It felt so nice to cool herself off. She did it a couple more times and ran her fingers through her hair, spreading the water down her scalp. Vanessa, likewise washed her face. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After the horses drank, they untacked the horses’ saddles and brushed them down. Phoena always enjoyed brushing her horse down. It was somehow relaxing to her. She always did it after riding, refusing to let a sable hand do it. Because Eamon knew this about her, he did not bother offering to do it for her. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena looked to Eamon as he brushed his horse. He scanned the area, as if making sure no one was hiding in the bushes. Phoena chucked softly to herself. She knew it was his job to protect her, but sometimes she felt he was a bit too paranoid. Or was it paranoia? She straightened her face as a thought came to her. Maybe he wasn’t paranoid, but more anxious—perhaps wanting something exciting to happen to break up the dull day. She knew she did not live an exciting life and that Eamon longed for adventure. She shook her head out of these thoughts. If he were looking for excitement, why would he do so now? He was finally on an adventure. True, all they had done all day was ride for hours, nothing exciting there. But he was finally breaking free of the castle boundaries. Why would he glance around as if hoping something would happen. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When Vanessa finished brushing her mare, she rubbed her hands together and exclaimed, “Well, I shall go find some firewood for us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon nodded in acknowledgment, but said nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Shall I come as well?” Phoena asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              “No,” Eamon said hastily. “I still need to set up camp, and you cannot leave my sight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena rolled her eyes playfully. “Yes, Mamma,” she teased. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But Eamon did not look amused at her joke. Even his usual straight face seemed harder than usual. He looked as if he wanted to say, “this isn’t a joke” but he did not speak. He did not need to. His glare said it all. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Come on, Eamon,” Vanessa said. He glared at her as if annoyed she had not addressed him by his knightly title. “She will not be alone.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is very reassuring,” he responded in unamused sarcasm. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’m not some helpless handmaid,” Vanessa defended. “If anything were to happen, it is not like I could not handle it myself. I’m a survivor of a dragon raid. It is not like I fled as fast as I could. I also helped others. I’m not completely defenseless.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Phoena felt a bit embarrassed that they were talking as if <em>she</em> was completely defenseless. Sure, she never trained as a knight, and she didn’t spend her life wandering alone like Vanessa had. But she was sure she wasn’t completely helpless.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon just stared at Vanessa. “No,” he said again as if his glare was not answer enough. “I am her guardian. I will not relinquish my responsibility to someone else.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanessa rolled her eyes again. “Look, what if we stayed within your sight? If anything happens, we will call out and you will see. It isn’t like we will go deep. This is a forest. There is wood everywhere.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Please?” Phoena tried. “I want to help.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon sighed. “Alright.” He gave another glare to Vanessa. “But within my sight.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              Vanessa gave a dramatic salute and said, “Yes sir.” She tried a playful smile, but it did not change Eamon’s expression. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon watched carefully as they walked a small distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I don’t think Sir Ardal likes me,” Vanessa whispered when they were a good distance away. They were within his sight, but in a whisper, might not have been within his hearing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis nodded with a regretful expression. “I agree. I understand her desire to help. I cannot express how sorry I am not to have sent out men sooner to help these people. But mine, and the whole council’s, better interests were for Orea. Had I known Princess Phoena would act against the council in such a way, I would have altered my vote.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Now we fear for the princess,” said Lady Adelpha. “It is a dangerous world out there. If there is a threat to Orea, it is an even greater threat to the princess when she is outside of the city’s protection.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is why we have called you here,” Lord Ahmar stated in his old, raspy voice. “We need you to gather several of your knights to go and find her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Lord Rupert huffed again. “Wouldn’t sending men out now be hypocritical?” he said pointedly. “Would not the people think us selfish for keeping them here and only sending them out when the princess goes missing?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis nodded respectfully to Rupert but stated, “Perhaps they may. However, I care more about the safety of Princess Phoena than I do about what the people think about us. If they look below the surface, they will see and agree that finding the princess is of highest priority. If something were to happen to her, the future of Orea will be lost.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert looked to General Renato. “You claim the loyalty of Sir Ardal and say that he would protect the princess. Tell us truthfully, with no bias to the fact you raised him, do you truly believe that he could protect the princess?”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato did not hesitate. “I know he will. I do not doubt his loyalties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “But do you believe he <em>could</em> protect her?” he emphasized. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” General Renato said emphatically. “I have no doubts in his abilities.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert gave a nod. “If she is protected, why should we worry about her safety? I say let her go on this minuscule assignment and keep the knights here to protect Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato felt heat in his neck—a little from frustration and a little from embarrassment. He never meant to minimize the danger that Princess Phoena could face. “That is not what I meant,” he stated calmly. “I do not doubt Sir Ardal’s abilities, but I do agree with Lord Otis. Princess Phoena is a greater priority than the pride of the council. I believe we should send knights to find her. Even though I place my full confidence in Sir Ardal, the more knights there are to protect Princess Phoena, the safer she will be. If something drastic were to happen and Sir Ardal were to fall protecting her,” he prayed that would not happen, “who then is there to protect her?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert puckered his lips in thought. “You do make a fair point.” He thought a moment longer before adding, “Alright, I will alter my vote. Send a <em>small</em> squad of knights to find her and bring her home. Just make sure there is adequate support left here in Orea to protect the city if an attack does come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato narrowed his eyes the slightest bit, annoyed with Rupert’s priorities. “Thank you. You need not worry. I will be sure there is adequate support here to protect the <em>people</em>,” he corrected. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert puckered his lips again, looking in a skeptical way, as if offended to have been judged. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis smiled softly. “It is unanimous. Thank you, General Renato. I hope it will not be an inconvenience to send knights right away.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I will gather men immediately,” General Renato said with a bowing nod. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As he left the council room, the smile he held all day was now flipped into a worried frown. A deep furrow on his brow, he wondered why Princess Phoena made such a hasty decision, and why Eamon would allow her to do so. He did understand her concern. He, himself, wished to have sent men earlier to the village, but he knew not to defy the orders of the council. Not to mention what Alexander would do when he found out that his daughter was gone. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He was also worried about the dangers that could arise. He did have full confidence in Eamon, but that was cause for one of his worries. He knew that Eamon would nobly sacrifice himself to protect Phoena. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He did not want to lose his son. 
            </p>
