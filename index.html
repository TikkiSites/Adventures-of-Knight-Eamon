          <p class="home-paragraph-1">
            Welcome to The Adventures of Knight Eamon, a website to combine illustrations with story. “A picture is worth a thousand words.” I wish to convey both pictures and words to create a fun, engaging website.
          </p>
          <h2 class="home-heading-2">For Authors</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            For any author that is looking for an illustrator, this website showcases many of my illustrations. See my work in the Gallery. If you like my style and feel it fits well with your stories, feel free to contact me. My contact information is provided on the Contact Me page. There will be a form you can fill out to tell me about your story and the types of illustrations you want for them. I look forward to hearing from you.
          </p>
          <h2 class="home-heading-3">For Adventure Seekers</h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-3">
            This website is not just for authors looking for an illustrator. It is for anyone that enjoys a good story with good art. This website is to showcase my illustrative work, but it is not just a gallery of art. My illustrations have a story along with them. If you like stories where you gradually come to know the characters and connect with them through their progressing story, you may enjoy my story. Visit the Story to begin your adventure!

            <p>
              The chapters and my illustrations will be displayed in a variety of ways. Some chapters will be written out in novel style, while others will be storyboarded like a comic book. Some illustrations will be detailed, while others will have a more cartoon feel to them. Please enjoy the variety of art and this web story.
            </p>

              Thank you for visiting and enjoy your next adventure!
