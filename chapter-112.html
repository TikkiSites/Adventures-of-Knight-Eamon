            <p>
              Gabriel Renato was still smiling near the end of the day. He had a long night ahead of him, followed by a long day, but he did not mind. He usually had a cheerful disposition, but on this day, he was especially happy. It wasn’t often that he got to walk with his son to the castle, and once Eamon was on duty, he would be stone faced and serious. He loved the opportunity to walk and reminisce with his son.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the late afternoon he was instructing some squires in prep work for the following day when something unexpected happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’d like you to prepare the eastern court for training. Tomorrow the men will practice their skills in…”
            </p>
            <p>
              He was suddenly cut off as the door suddenly flew open and a messenger ran through. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “General Renato!” he gasped as he caught his breath. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Woah, there,” Gabriel said as he walked to the messenger. “Breathe easy now. What is your rush?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Advisor Otis and the council want to speak with you immediately!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel furrowed his brow the slightest bit. “The council? Why would they want to speak with me? What has happened?”
            </p>
            <p>
              The messenger shook his head. “I’m not sure,” he panted. “They didn’t tell me. They just said it was urgent.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel nodded. He turned briefly to the squires. “You know what to do from here. When you are done, you may return home.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Thank you, sir,” they said in unison.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Gabriel approached the council room, he heard a frantic conversation. No one was yelling, but he could not tell what they were saying because they all talked over each other. The urgency in their tone was obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              “You summoned me,” he stated as he entered and all eyes turned to him.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” Otis said. “Please, close the door.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              He closed the door, looking to the council questioningly. “What is wrong? What has happened that you need me?” King Titus often invited him to council meetings to give insight. He was not an official member of the council, but King Titus appreciated his contributions. However, the council members rarely invited him in for any simple matter. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “The princess is gone!” Lady Adelpha said with horror.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Gone?!” Gabriel exclaimed. “What do you mean?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “She ran away,” Lord Rupert stated with a humph.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general furrowed his brow in a little confusion. “Ran away? Why would she do that? Sir Ardal would ensure something like that would not happen,” he added with surety. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “He went with her,” Lord Rupert huffed. “Along with that new handmaid.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “What?” Gabriel said in disbelief. “He would not do that! He has sworn to protect the Princess and would not allow such a reckless act. Where did you get this information?” He demanded. 
            </p>
            <p> 
              “Well,” Lord Otis put in, “It was not so much running away as it was a sense of duty.” He handed the general a folded parchment. “A boy came to the castle with this message from Princess Phoena.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Gabriel read it. In it, Princess Phoena expressed her need to serve the people that had come to her for help. He understood that if she felt the need to go out, Eamon would not leave her side. He was honorable and would not break his oath to the king.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I see,” he said, handing the parchment back. “I cannot say I blame her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis nodded with a regretful expression. “I agree. I understand her desire to help. I cannot express how sorry I am not to have sent out men sooner to help these people. But mine, and the whole council’s, better interests were for Orea. Had I known Princess Phoena would act against the council in such a way, I would have altered my vote.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Now we fear for the princess,” said Lady Adelpha. “It is a dangerous world out there. If there is a threat to Orea, it is an even greater threat to the princess when she is outside of the city’s protection.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              “That is why we have called you here,” Lord Ahmar stated in his old, raspy voice. “We need you to gather several of your knights to go and find her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Lord Rupert huffed again. “Wouldn’t sending men out now be hypocritical?” he said pointedly. “Would not the people think us selfish for keeping them here and only sending them out when the princess goes missing?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis nodded respectfully to Rupert but stated, “Perhaps they may. However, I care more about the safety of Princess Phoena than I do about what the people think about us. If they look below the surface, they will see and agree that finding the princess is of highest priority. If something were to happen to her, the future of Orea will be lost.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert looked to General Renato. “You claim the loyalty of Sir Ardal and say that he would protect the princess. Tell us truthfully, with no bias to the fact you raised him, do you truly believe that he could protect the princess?”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato did not hesitate. “I know he will. I do not doubt his loyalties.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “But do you believe he <em>could</em> protect her?” he emphasized. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” General Renato said emphatically. “I have no doubts in his abilities.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert gave a nod. “If she is protected, why should we worry about her safety? I say let her go on this minuscule assignment and keep the knights here to protect Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato felt heat in his neck—a little from frustration and a little from embarrassment. He never meant to minimize the danger that Princess Phoena could face. “That is not what I meant,” he stated calmly. “I do not doubt Sir Ardal’s abilities, but I do agree with Lord Otis. Princess Phoena is a greater priority than the pride of the council. I believe we should send knights to find her. Even though I place my full confidence in Sir Ardal, the more knights there are to protect Princess Phoena, the safer she will be. If something drastic were to happen and Sir Ardal were to fall protecting her,” he prayed that would not happen, “who then is there to protect her?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert puckered his lips in thought. “You do make a fair point.” He thought a moment longer before adding, “Alright, I will alter my vote. Send a <em>small</em> squad of knights to find her and bring her home. Just make sure there is adequate support left here in Orea to protect the city if an attack does come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              General Renato narrowed his eyes the slightest bit, annoyed with Rupert’s priorities. “Thank you. You need not worry. I will be sure there is adequate support here to protect the <em>people</em>,” he corrected. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Rupert puckered his lips again, looking in a skeptical way, as if offended to have been judged. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Otis smiled softly. “It is unanimous. Thank you, General Renato. I hope it will not be an inconvenience to send knights right away.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I will gather men immediately,” General Renato said with a bowing nod. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As he left the council room, the smile he held all day was now flipped into a worried frown. A deep furrow on his brow, he wondered why Princess Phoena made such a hasty decision, and why Eamon would allow her to do so. He did understand her concern. He, himself, wished to have sent men earlier to the village, but he knew not to defy the orders of the council. Not to mention what Alexander would do when he found out that his daughter was gone. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He was also worried about the dangers that could arise. He did have full confidence in Eamon, but that was cause for one of his worries. He knew that Eamon would nobly sacrifice himself to protect Phoena. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He did not want to lose his son. 
            </p>
