            <p>
              Eamon Ardal knelt before the king, head bowed in humble respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Today is a momentous occasion,” King Alexander Titus proclaimed. “Never before, during my rule, has anyone proven to deserve this honor at such a young age. Though only fourteen, Eamon Ardal has quickly advanced in his training and now has the honor to bare the title of Knight of Orea.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              A knight that stood by the king held out the sword of ceremonies. After taking the sword, the king outstretched his arm toward the boy kneeling before him. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “You have proven loyal, dedicated, and honorable,” King Titus continued. “My trust in you has not been in vain.” Lowering the sword to each of Eamon Ardal’s shoulders, he proclaimed, “With the power of all Orea, the honor of your ancestors, and the authority I hold, I dub thee, Sir Eamon Ardal, Knight of Orea.”
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus lowered the sword and nodded to his daughter. Princess Phoena stepped forward until she stood right in front of Knight Ardal. She held a golden laurel crown.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The young princess placed the laurel on the knight’s head and said, “The honor of the kingdom of Orea is now placed on the crown of your head.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The young knight stood. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess was handed the knight’s new sword. Placing the sword in his hands, she continued, “The responsibility of protecting Orea is in your hands.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Then handing him his shield she added, “And may the protection of your ancestors be your strength.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The princess smiled softly as she stepped back to the side of her father. 
            </p>
            <p>
              King Titus raised his hand and shouted, “Honor to your new brother guardian, Sir Ardal, Knight of Orea!”
            </p>
            <p>
              The crowd cheered and shouted, “Sir Ardal!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon Ardal turned and faced the crowd. As the light shown on him, he felt the strength and honor of his new brothers of the knighthood, the respect of the subjects, and the strength of his father. He had waited for this moment for a long time. Despite the happiness he felt, he kept his composure, a skill he learned in his early years. He showed respect to the king, the princess, and to all around him with a humble bow, but he showed no emotion on his face.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter-division">

            </p>
            <p>
              “Sir Ardal,” King Titus said to Eamon soon after the knighting ceremony. 
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes, Your Majesty?” Eamon said with a bow.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I have an important mission for you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Eamon felt excitement well up in his chest. He squared his shoulders, honored to so soon be given an assignment directly from the king himself. “What is your request?” he said, calmly.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I need you to guard my daughter.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The excitement faded. Showing only a little confusion, he said, “I’m sorry? Guard your daughter?”
            </p>
            <p>
              “Yes,” King Titus said. “I am going to the town tomorrow with her, and I need you to watch over her.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Though he was disappointed and confused, Eamon did not show it. “Yes Sire. It would be an honor.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The king placed his hand on the knight’s shoulder and smiled. “Thank you. This is very important to me.” 
            </p>
            <p>
              As the king turned and left, Eamon’s shoulders slumped the slightest bit. He was hoping for a more daring and exciting mission. Had he not proven his value to the king? This was his first mission, though. It would not look good for him to turn it down, no matter how small the task seemed to be. He was sure he would be assigned to greater things in the near future.
